We encourage you to learn about third parties‚Äô privacy and security policies before providing them with information. 7.

Your California Privacy Rights We will not share any Personal Data with third-parties for their direct marketing purposes to the extent prohibited by California law. If our practices change, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws and will notify you in advance. 9. Interest Based Advertising Interest based advertising is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order to predict an individual‚Äôs preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.  We work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be interested in the Brightr Travel products or services so that we can send them promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them on the websites and mobile apps of other entities.  These third parties include: (a) advertising networks, which collect information about a person‚Äôs interests when that person views or interacts with one of their advertisements; (2) attribution partners, which measure the effectiveness of certain advertisements; and (3) business partners, which collect information when a person views or interacts with one of their advertisements.  In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them. Individuals may submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties. We may use special tools that are commonly used for this purpose, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile advertising IDs, flash cookies, and similar technologies. We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.  The information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in response to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties‚Äô platforms.  We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others. We, or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites; to present more personalized content; to provide more useful and relevant ads - for example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you the same ones repeatedly; to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites and Sites, or to display or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a person‚Äôs perceived interest in products or services similar to those that we offer.  Our interest-based ads may be served to you in emails or on third-party platforms. We may serve these ads about our products or services or send commercial communications directly ourselves or through these third parties.  Visitors may opt out of receiving interest based advertising by advertising networks that may be delivered to them on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers; and http://www.networkadvertising.org. These features will opt a Visitor out of many ‚Äì but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. 10. Do Not Track Policy California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals.  In the meantime, you may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites. If you want to opt out of this online behavioral advertising, visit the following sites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers and http://www.networkadvertising.org.  This will opt you out of many ‚Äì but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. Choices you make may be browser and device specific. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or a different computer or device, you may need to update your opt-out choices. Other third-party Sites provide visitors with the ability to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on their Sites that you need to control through your settings on that Site. For example, to opt out of Google‚Äôs use of your online behavior for advertising purposes, visit Google‚Äôs Ad Settings page. 11. Third Party Cookies California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose whether other third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual\\'s online activities from their site or service. We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Site. These third parties include (1) business partners, which collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Site; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements.  The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or promotional material on this Site and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.  The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based advertisements on the Services have limited access to a small amount of information about your profile and your device, which is necessary to serve you advertisements that are tailored to your apparent interests. It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or services.  We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify you (such as email address); however, these third parties may have access to information about your device (such as IP or MAC address). We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Other than as discussed in this document, we have no control over these third parties.  11.1 The Following Types of Cookies Are Used in the Site:  ‚Ä¢ strictly necessary/essential cookies - These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website.

They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator‚Äôs permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation. 12. Minors and Children‚Äôs Privacy Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that Personal Data has been collected on the Service from persons under 18 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 18 years of age has obtained an Account on the Service, then you may alert us at support@gobeacon.me and request that we delete that child‚Äôs Personal Data from our systems.

To the extent that a minor has posted such content on the Service, the minor has the right to have this content deleted or removed using the deletion or removal options detailed in this Privacy Policy. If you have any question regarding this topic, please contact us as indicated in the ‚ÄúHow to Contact Us‚Äù section. Please be aware that, although we offer this deletion capability, the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information. 13. Data Security We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the ‚ÄúHow to Contact Us‚Äù section.  If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law. 14. Data Retention We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User‚Äôs account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:  ‚Ä¢ the contents of closed accounts are deleted within 3 months of the date of closure;  ‚Ä¢ backups are kept for 3 months;  ‚Ä¢ billing information is retained for a period of 7 years as of their provision to Brightr Travel in accordance with the Estonian accounting and taxation laws  ‚Ä¢ information on legal transactions between Client and Brightr Travel is retained for a period of 10 years as of their provision to Brightr Travel in accordance with the general limitation period set for civil claims in the Estonian General Part of the Civil Code Act 15. Settings Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain Personal Data, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service. We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. 16. Data Transfer We may transfer, process and store Personal Data we collect through the Services in centralized databases and with service providers located in the U.S. The U.S. may not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services. When we transfer Personal Data to the U.S., we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy.  The Service is hosted in the United States. EU customers‚Äô databases will be hosted with HiVelocity located in Atlanta, Georgia. Regardless of the database being hosted in the USA, if you choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you may be transferring your Client Data and Personal Data outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing by our service providers listed in the Brightr Travel Terms of Service. We will comply with GDPR requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S. Also, we may transfer your data to the U.S., the EEA, or other countries or regions deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection of personal data in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. 17. Data Controller and Data Processor Brightr Travel does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User via the Service. Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data. Brightr Travel is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users.  Because Brightr Travel does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Brightr Travel is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter ‚ÄúGDPR‚Äù) and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR. Brightr Travel should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Brightr Travel does not independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Brightr Travel in connection with Brightr Travel‚Äôs provision of Services to Clients. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.  The Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.  Brightr Travel is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors‚Äô servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is Brightr Travel responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information. 18. Changes and Updates to this Policy Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time. If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision, and will comply with applicable law. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy. 19. How to Contact Us Please contact us with any questions or comments about this Policy, your Personal Data, our use and disclosure practices, or your consent choices by email at support@gobeacon.me.

They are used by web developers to help users navigate their websites efficiently and perform certain functions.\\nDue to their core role of enhancing/enabling usability or site processes, disabling cookies may prevent users from using certain websites.\\n\\n\\n\\nCookies are created when a user\\'s browser loads a particular website. The website sends information to the browser which then creates a text file.\\nEvery time the user goes back to the same website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the website\\'s server.\\nComputer cookies are created not just by the website the user is browsing but also by other websites that run ads, widgets, or other elements on the page being loaded.\\nThese cookies regulate how the ads appear or how the widgets and other elements function on the page.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more about managing cookies on different browsers.\\nStandard uses for browser cookies\\nWebsite servers set cookies to help authenticate the user if the user logs in to a secure area of the website. Login information is stored in a cookie so the user can enter and leave the website without having to re-enter the same authentication information over and over.\\nSession cookies are also used by the server to store information about user page activities so users can easily pick up where they left off on the server\\'s pages. By default, web pages really don\\'t have any \\'memory\\'. Cookies tell the server what pages to show the user so the user doesn\\'t have to remember or start navigating the site all over again.\\nCookies act as a sort of “bookmark” within the site. Similarly, cookies can store ordering information needed to make shopping carts work instead of forcing the user to remember all the items the user put in the shopping cart.\\nPersistent or tracking cookies are also employed to store user preferences. Many websites allow the user to customize how information is presented through site layouts or themes. These changes make the site easier to navigate and/or let the user leave a part of the user\\'s “personality” at the site.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more about the different types of cookies.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Team\\'s Latest Research\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeaving Behind Your Logins: More Than Half of Internet Users Don’t Plan for the Unexpected [Study]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAd Blocker Adoption: Majority of Americans Block Ads — Do They Feel Bad About It?

Cookies use a plain text format. They are not compiled pieces of code so they cannot be executed nor are they self-executing. Accordingly, they cannot make copies of themselves and spread to other networks to execute and replicate again.\\nSince they cannot perform these functions, they fall outside the standard virus definition.\\nCookies CAN be used for malicious purposes though. Since they store information about a user\\'s browsing preferences and history, both on a specific site and browsing among several sites, cookies can be used to act as a form of spyware.\\nMany anti-spyware products are well aware of this problem and routinely flag cookies as candidates for deletion after standard virus and/or spyware scans. See here for some privacy issues and concerns.\\nThe way responsible and ethical web developers deal with privacy issues caused by cookie tracking is by including clear descriptions of how cookies are deployed on their site.\\nIf you are a web developer and need advice on the implementation of cookies and a privacy policy, you can contact us by the inquiry form at the bottom of the page.\\nThese privacy policies should explain what kind of information is collected and how the information is used. Organizations utilizing and displaying a proper and useful cookie policy and privacy policy include\\xa0LinkedIn\\xa0and\\xa0Networkadvertising.org.\\nMost browsers have built-in privacy settings that provide differing levels of cookie acceptance, expiration time, and disposal after a user has visited a particular site. Backing up your computer\\xa0can give you the peace of mind that your files are safe.\\nComputer cookies help\\nComputer cookies make our experience on the internet easier, quicker, and much less complicated.\\nImagine trying to log in to your favorite website, social media account, or email and having to remember and type in your username and password every time — it would be almost impossible. Just to cope and make it easier you would probably start using the same username and password for every account which would be very dangerous and compromise your cybersecurity cookies are essential for internet surfing.\\nThey help you and they help the website owner by helping to know their audience and customer.\\nCookies help identify and recognize that it\\'s you and allow you quick entry and they also help the website owner to identify the bad and malicious visitors who may be bots trying to enforce their way into the code of the website looking for vulnerabilities to place malicious and hijacking code that will give you malware.\\nCookies don\\'t identify you personally and they can\\'t tell who you are but they can remember the device you are using and thus make it simpler for you to use.\\nOther cookie-based threats\\nSince identity protection is highly valued and is every internet user\\'s right, it pays to be aware of what threat cookies can pose.\\nAs cookies are transmitted back and forth between a browser and website, if an attacker or unauthorized person gets in between the data transmission, the sensitive cookie information can be intercepted.\\nAlthough relatively rare, this can happen if the browser is connecting to the server using an unencrypted network like a non-secured Wi-Fi channel.\\nInternet security is only attainable if you regularly use an antivirus protection program.\\nOther cookie-based attacks involve exploiting faulty cookie-setting systems on servers. If a website doesn\\'t require browsers to use encrypted channels only, attackers can use this vulnerability to trick browsers into sending sensitive information over insecure channels.\\nThe attackers then siphon off the sensitive data for unauthorized access purposes.\\nNew laws for the use of cookies and other technologies that store online user information\\nOn May 25, 2018, a set of new European privacy laws called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect.\\nRather than the \"Opt out\" option for website visitors, websites will need to specifically gain the consent of their visitors and they must \"Opt In\" to be able to store cookies on their computer or other devices.\\nThis is expected to be difficult to manage and enforcement will more than likely be done subtlely and with encouragement rather than with the threat of fines and penalties.\\nBusinesses in the EU have some great resources that can help them with their cookie compliance. The European Union has an\\xa0internet handbook\\xa0that explains to businesses their requirements under the legislation and has a \\'cookie kit\" to help them comply.\\nIn 2018, California also signed new privacy regulations under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Similar to the GDPR, the CCPA was created to protect consumers’ personal data and give businesses a set of standards to follow with regards to that data. Businesses must disclose what personal information is being collected and sold about their users. Users have the right to request that businesses delete their data and the right to opt out of data collection. The CCPA went into effect January 1, 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat does the new law say?\\nUnder the GDPR, the new requirement is essentially that cookies can only be placed on machines where the user or subscriber has given their consent.\\n6 (1) Subject to paragraph (4), a person shall not store or gain access to information stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user unless the requirements of paragraph (2) are met.(2) The requirements are that the subscriber or user of that terminal equipment-- (a) is provided with clear and comprehensive information about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, that information; and (b) has given his or her consent.(3) Where an electronic communications network is used by the same person to store or access information in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user on more than one occasion, it is sufficient for the purposes of this regulation that the requirements of paragraph (2) are met in respect of the initial use.(3a) For the purposes of paragraph (2), consent may be signified by a subscriber who amends or sets controls on the internet browser which the subscriber uses or by using another application or program to signify consent.(4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the technical storage of, or access to, information-- (a) for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network; or (b) where such storage or access is strictly necessary for the provision of an information society service requested by the subscriber or user.\\nMore information on the new changes can be found here.\\nKey tips for safe and responsible cookie-based web browsing\\nDue to their flexibility and the fact that many of the largest and most-visited websites use cookies by default, cookies are almost unavoidable. Disabling cookies will lock a user out of many of the most widely-used sites on the Internet like Youtube, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and others.\\nEven search settings require cookies for language settings. Here are some tips you can use to ensure worry-free cookie-based browsing:\\nCustomize your browser\\'s cookie settings to reflect your comfort level with cookie security or use our guide to delete cookies.\\nIf you are very comfortable with cookies and you are the only person using your computer, you may want to set long expiration time frames for storing your personal access information and browsing history.\\nIf you share access on your computer, you may want to set your browser to clear private browsing data every time you close your browser.\\nWhile not as secure as rejecting cookies outright, this option lets you access cookie-based websites while deleting any sensitive information after your browsing session.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstall and keep antispyware applications updated\\nMany spyware detection, cleanup applications, and spyware removers include attack site detection. They block your browser from accessing websites designed to exploit browser vulnerabilities or download malicious software. \\nMake sure your browser is updated\\nIf you haven\\'t already, set your browser to update automatically. This eliminates security vulnerabilities caused by outdated browsers. Many cookie-based exploits are based on exploiting older browsers\\' security shortcomings. \\nCookies are everywhere and can\\'t really be avoided if you wish to enjoy the biggest and best websites out there. With a clear understanding of how they operate and how they help your browsing experience, you can take the necessary security measures to ensure that you browse the Net confidently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManaging mobile cookies and security\\nThe mobile landscape is so much broader than a single platform.\\nWe cover mobile cookie use plus cybersecurity issues that can be found in the mobile sector.\\nKnowing how to safely surf the web is one of the most important aspects of personal cyber security and education is one of the most powerful tools. \\nIncluded below are a few points to keep in mind when using your Android/iPhone (or any mobile device) to ensure that you are safe and secure on the web.\\n\\nCookies are just text files that store information about your computer or mobile device. These cookies can be necessary for the website to operate and function.\\nBe skeptical! Always research a program or application before installation. Research the application and the app developer to establish credibility. Review the product/developer website for customer support phone numbers or emails and review the social media pages to see what people are saying about the product.\\nAvoid downloading apps or programs that found you. If you did not actively seek a program then avoid installing apps from pushy ads or automatic downloads.\\nStay current with application and operating system updates. Updates often include security patches that are designed to fix newly discovered vulnerabilities.\\nInstall and USE an antivirus application to protect you from threats that slip past your personal defense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest Stories\\n\\nSee More Stories →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurfshark VPN vs. StrongVPN 2024: Which One Offers the Best Value?\\nFind out if Surfshark’s feature-rich, budget-friendly service or StrongVPN’s straightforward, reliable protection is the right choice for your online privacy needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorton vs. Aura Antivirus 2024: Can A Vintage Antivirus Stand Up to a Newcomer?\\nNorton and Aura antivirus solutions look similar on the surface but a few key differences will help you decide what you need in your security provider.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nuBlock Origin vs. Adblock Plus 2024: Which Ad Blocker Is Right for You?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdClear Review 2024: Is This Free Ad Blocker for Android Users Worth It?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrustnav Review 2024: A Good Free Ad Blocker\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Best Surfshark VPN Alternatives of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNordVPN vs. Total VPN 2024: Secure Streaming vs. Ultimate Browsing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s a Sneak Peek at the New Apple Passwords App [June 2024]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAS SEEN ON\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore Popular Topics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAntivirus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVPN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPassword Managers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAd Blockers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentity Theft\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Copyright © 2024  All About Cookies  111 E.

ADA compliance means ensuring accessibility for individuals with disabilities, which can include visual, auditory, and physical impairments. Failing to make a website accessible can lead to legal liabilities and loss of potential clients.\\n\\nIn addition to legal and ethical considerations, maintaining ADA compliance helps to create an inclusive environment and promote diversity. Small businesses can achieve ADA compliance through simple measures such as adding alternative text to images, using descriptive page titles, and providing clear navigation. Investing in ADA compliance not only benefits individuals with disabilities, but also demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and attracts a wider customer base. By embracing accessibility, small businesses can thrive in the digital economy and make a positive impact on society.\\n\\u200b\\nCheck out this website for all the information you need to learn and\\xa0Get Started!\\xa0HOMEEXPLOREMEMBERSABOUT25TH ANNIVERSARYMHMS \"CLOSE UP\"CONTACTRESOURCESMoreUse tab to navigate through the menu items.bottom of page\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://www.missionhillmainstreet.com/resources', 'title': 'RESOURCES | MHMS - Mission Hill', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them. Individuals may submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties. We may use special tools that are commonly used for this purpose, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile advertising IDs, flash cookies, and similar technologies. We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.  The information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in response to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties‚Äô platforms.  We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others. We, or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites; to present more personalized content; to provide more useful and relevant ads - for example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you the same ones repeatedly; to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites and Sites, or to display or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a person‚Äôs perceived interest in products or services similar to those that we offer.  Our interest-based ads may be served to you in emails or on third-party platforms. We may serve these ads about our products or services or send commercial communications directly ourselves or through these third parties.  Visitors may opt out of receiving interest based advertising by advertising networks that may be delivered to them on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers; and http://www.networkadvertising.org. These features will opt a Visitor out of many ‚Äì but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. 10. Do Not Track Policy California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals.  In the meantime, you may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites. If you want to opt out of this online behavioral advertising, visit the following sites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers and http://www.networkadvertising.org.  This will opt you out of many ‚Äì but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. Choices you make may be browser and device specific. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or a different computer or device, you may need to update your opt-out choices. Other third-party Sites provide visitors with the ability to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on their Sites that you need to control through your settings on that Site. For example, to opt out of Google‚Äôs use of your online behavior for advertising purposes, visit Google‚Äôs Ad Settings page. 11. Third Party Cookies California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose whether other third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual\\'s online activities from their site or service. We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Site. These third parties include (1) business partners, which collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Site; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements.  The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or promotional material on this Site and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.  The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based advertisements on the Services have limited access to a small amount of information about your profile and your device, which is necessary to serve you advertisements that are tailored to your apparent interests. It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or services.  We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify you (such as email address); however, these third parties may have access to information about your device (such as IP or MAC address). We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Other than as discussed in this document, we have no control over these third parties.  11.1 The Following Types of Cookies Are Used in the Site:  ‚Ä¢ strictly necessary/essential cookies - These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website.

Minors and Children‚Äôs Privacy Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that Personal Data has been collected on the Service from persons under 18 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 18 years of age has obtained an Account on the Service, then you may alert us at support@gobeacon.me and request that we delete that child‚Äôs Personal Data from our systems.  The Service is not intended to be used by minors, and is not intended to be used to post content to share publicly or with friends. To the extent that a minor has posted such content on the Service, the minor has the right to have this content deleted or removed using the deletion or removal options detailed in this Privacy Policy. If you have any question regarding this topic, please contact us as indicated in the ‚ÄúHow to Contact Us‚Äù section. Please be aware that, although we offer this deletion capability, the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information. 13. Data Security We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the ‚ÄúHow to Contact Us‚Äù section.  If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law. 14. Data Retention We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User‚Äôs account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:  ‚Ä¢ the contents of closed accounts are deleted within 3 months of the date of closure;  ‚Ä¢ backups are kept for 3 months;  ‚Ä¢ billing information is retained for a period of 7 years as of their provision to Brightr Travel in accordance with the Estonian accounting and taxation laws  ‚Ä¢ information on legal transactions between Client and Brightr Travel is retained for a period of 10 years as of their provision to Brightr Travel in accordance with the general limitation period set for civil claims in the Estonian General Part of the Civil Code Act 15. Settings Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain Personal Data, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service. We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. 16. Data Transfer We may transfer, process and store Personal Data we collect through the Services in centralized databases and with service providers located in the U.S. The U.S. may not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services. When we transfer Personal Data to the U.S., we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy.  The Service is hosted in the United States. EU customers‚Äô databases will be hosted with HiVelocity located in Atlanta, Georgia. Regardless of the database being hosted in the USA, if you choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you may be transferring your Client Data and Personal Data outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing by our service providers listed in the Brightr Travel Terms of Service. We will comply with GDPR requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S. Also, we may transfer your data to the U.S., the EEA, or other countries or regions deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection of personal data in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. 17. Data Controller and Data Processor Brightr Travel does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User via the Service. Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data. Brightr Travel is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users.  Because Brightr Travel does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Brightr Travel is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter ‚ÄúGDPR‚Äù) and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR. Brightr Travel should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Brightr Travel does not independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Brightr Travel in connection with Brightr Travel‚Äôs provision of Services to Clients. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.  The Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.  Brightr Travel is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors‚Äô servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is Brightr Travel responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information. 18. Changes and Updates to this Policy Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time. If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision, and will comply with applicable law. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy. 19. How to Contact Us Please contact us with any questions or comments about this Policy, your Personal Data, our use and disclosure practices, or your consent choices by email at support@gobeacon.me.

They are used by web developers to help users navigate their websites efficiently and perform certain functions.\\nDue to their core role of enhancing/enabling usability or site processes, disabling cookies may prevent users from using certain websites.\\n\\n\\n\\nCookies are created when a user\\'s browser loads a particular website. The website sends information to the browser which then creates a text file.\\nEvery time the user goes back to the same website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the website\\'s server.\\nComputer cookies are created not just by the website the user is browsing but also by other websites that run ads, widgets, or other elements on the page being loaded.\\nThese cookies regulate how the ads appear or how the widgets and other elements function on the page.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more about managing cookies on different browsers.\\nStandard uses for browser cookies\\nWebsite servers set cookies to help authenticate the user if the user logs in to a secure area of the website. Login information is stored in a cookie so the user can enter and leave the website without having to re-enter the same authentication information over and over.\\nSession cookies are also used by the server to store information about user page activities so users can easily pick up where they left off on the server\\'s pages. By default, web pages really don\\'t have any \\'memory\\'. Cookies tell the server what pages to show the user so the user doesn\\'t have to remember or start navigating the site all over again.\\nCookies act as a sort of “bookmark” within the site. Similarly, cookies can store ordering information needed to make shopping carts work instead of forcing the user to remember all the items the user put in the shopping cart.\\nPersistent or tracking cookies are also employed to store user preferences. Many websites allow the user to customize how information is presented through site layouts or themes. These changes make the site easier to navigate and/or let the user leave a part of the user\\'s “personality” at the site.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more about the different types of cookies.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Team\\'s Latest Research\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeaving Behind Your Logins: More Than Half of Internet Users Don’t Plan for the Unexpected [Study]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAd Blocker Adoption: Majority of Americans Block Ads — Do They Feel Bad About It?

Cookies use a plain text format. They are not compiled pieces of code so they cannot be executed nor are they self-executing. Accordingly, they cannot make copies of themselves and spread to other networks to execute and replicate again.\\nSince they cannot perform these functions, they fall outside the standard virus definition.\\nCookies CAN be used for malicious purposes though. Since they store information about a user\\'s browsing preferences and history, both on a specific site and browsing among several sites, cookies can be used to act as a form of spyware.\\nMany anti-spyware products are well aware of this problem and routinely flag cookies as candidates for deletion after standard virus and/or spyware scans. See here for some privacy issues and concerns.\\nThe way responsible and ethical web developers deal with privacy issues caused by cookie tracking is by including clear descriptions of how cookies are deployed on their site.\\nIf you are a web developer and need advice on the implementation of cookies and a privacy policy, you can contact us by the inquiry form at the bottom of the page.\\nThese privacy policies should explain what kind of information is collected and how the information is used. Organizations utilizing and displaying a proper and useful cookie policy and privacy policy include\\xa0LinkedIn\\xa0and\\xa0Networkadvertising.org.\\nMost browsers have built-in privacy settings that provide differing levels of cookie acceptance, expiration time, and disposal after a user has visited a particular site. Backing up your computer\\xa0can give you the peace of mind that your files are safe.\\nComputer cookies help\\nComputer cookies make our experience on the internet easier, quicker, and much less complicated.\\nImagine trying to log in to your favorite website, social media account, or email and having to remember and type in your username and password every time — it would be almost impossible. Just to cope and make it easier you would probably start using the same username and password for every account which would be very dangerous and compromise your cybersecurity cookies are essential for internet surfing.\\nThey help you and they help the website owner by helping to know their audience and customer.\\nCookies help identify and recognize that it\\'s you and allow you quick entry and they also help the website owner to identify the bad and malicious visitors who may be bots trying to enforce their way into the code of the website looking for vulnerabilities to place malicious and hijacking code that will give you malware.\\nCookies don\\'t identify you personally and they can\\'t tell who you are but they can remember the device you are using and thus make it simpler for you to use.\\nOther cookie-based threats\\nSince identity protection is highly valued and is every internet user\\'s right, it pays to be aware of what threat cookies can pose.\\nAs cookies are transmitted back and forth between a browser and website, if an attacker or unauthorized person gets in between the data transmission, the sensitive cookie information can be intercepted.\\nAlthough relatively rare, this can happen if the browser is connecting to the server using an unencrypted network like a non-secured Wi-Fi channel.\\nInternet security is only attainable if you regularly use an antivirus protection program.\\nOther cookie-based attacks involve exploiting faulty cookie-setting systems on servers. If a website doesn\\'t require browsers to use encrypted channels only, attackers can use this vulnerability to trick browsers into sending sensitive information over insecure channels.\\nThe attackers then siphon off the sensitive data for unauthorized access purposes.\\nNew laws for the use of cookies and other technologies that store online user information\\nOn May 25, 2018, a set of new European privacy laws called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect.\\nRather than the \"Opt out\" option for website visitors, websites will need to specifically gain the consent of their visitors and they must \"Opt In\" to be able to store cookies on their computer or other devices.\\nThis is expected to be difficult to manage and enforcement will more than likely be done subtlely and with encouragement rather than with the threat of fines and penalties.\\nBusinesses in the EU have some great resources that can help them with their cookie compliance. The European Union has an\\xa0internet handbook\\xa0that explains to businesses their requirements under the legislation and has a \\'cookie kit\" to help them comply.\\nIn 2018, California also signed new privacy regulations under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Similar to the GDPR, the CCPA was created to protect consumers’ personal data and give businesses a set of standards to follow with regards to that data. Businesses must disclose what personal information is being collected and sold about their users. Users have the right to request that businesses delete their data and the right to opt out of data collection. The CCPA went into effect January 1, 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat does the new law say?\\nUnder the GDPR, the new requirement is essentially that cookies can only be placed on machines where the user or subscriber has given their consent.\\n6 (1) Subject to paragraph (4), a person shall not store or gain access to information stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user unless the requirements of paragraph (2) are met.(2) The requirements are that the subscriber or user of that terminal equipment-- (a) is provided with clear and comprehensive information about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, that information; and (b) has given his or her consent.(3) Where an electronic communications network is used by the same person to store or access information in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user on more than one occasion, it is sufficient for the purposes of this regulation that the requirements of paragraph (2) are met in respect of the initial use.(3a) For the purposes of paragraph (2), consent may be signified by a subscriber who amends or sets controls on the internet browser which the subscriber uses or by using another application or program to signify consent.(4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the technical storage of, or access to, information-- (a) for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network; or (b) where such storage or access is strictly necessary for the provision of an information society service requested by the subscriber or user.\\nMore information on the new changes can be found here.\\nKey tips for safe and responsible cookie-based web browsing\\nDue to their flexibility and the fact that many of the largest and most-visited websites use cookies by default, cookies are almost unavoidable. Disabling cookies will lock a user out of many of the most widely-used sites on the Internet like Youtube, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and others.\\nEven search settings require cookies for language settings. Here are some tips you can use to ensure worry-free cookie-based browsing:\\nCustomize your browser\\'s cookie settings to reflect your comfort level with cookie security or use our guide to delete cookies.\\nIf you are very comfortable with cookies and you are the only person using your computer, you may want to set long expiration time frames for storing your personal access information and browsing history.\\nIf you share access on your computer, you may want to set your browser to clear private browsing data every time you close your browser.\\nWhile not as secure as rejecting cookies outright, this option lets you access cookie-based websites while deleting any sensitive information after your browsing session.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstall and keep antispyware applications updated\\nMany spyware detection, cleanup applications, and spyware removers include attack site detection. They block your browser from accessing websites designed to exploit browser vulnerabilities or download malicious software. \\nMake sure your browser is updated\\nIf you haven\\'t already, set your browser to update automatically. This eliminates security vulnerabilities caused by outdated browsers. Many cookie-based exploits are based on exploiting older browsers\\' security shortcomings. \\nCookies are everywhere and can\\'t really be avoided if you wish to enjoy the biggest and best websites out there. With a clear understanding of how they operate and how they help your browsing experience, you can take the necessary security measures to ensure that you browse the Net confidently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManaging mobile cookies and security\\nThe mobile landscape is so much broader than a single platform.\\nWe cover mobile cookie use plus cybersecurity issues that can be found in the mobile sector.\\nKnowing how to safely surf the web is one of the most important aspects of personal cyber security and education is one of the most powerful tools. \\nIncluded below are a few points to keep in mind when using your Android/iPhone (or any mobile device) to ensure that you are safe and secure on the web.\\n\\nCookies are just text files that store information about your computer or mobile device. These cookies can be necessary for the website to operate and function.\\nBe skeptical! Always research a program or application before installation. Research the application and the app developer to establish credibility. Review the product/developer website for customer support phone numbers or emails and review the social media pages to see what people are saying about the product.\\nAvoid downloading apps or programs that found you. If you did not actively seek a program then avoid installing apps from pushy ads or automatic downloads.\\nStay current with application and operating system updates. Updates often include security patches that are designed to fix newly discovered vulnerabilities.\\nInstall and USE an antivirus application to protect you from threats that slip past your personal defense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest Stories\\n\\nSee More Stories →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurfshark VPN vs. StrongVPN 2024: Which One Offers the Best Value?\\nFind out if Surfshark’s feature-rich, budget-friendly service or StrongVPN’s straightforward, reliable protection is the right choice for your online privacy needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorton vs. Aura Antivirus 2024: Can A Vintage Antivirus Stand Up to a Newcomer?\\nNorton and Aura antivirus solutions look similar on the surface but a few key differences will help you decide what you need in your security provider.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nuBlock Origin vs. Adblock Plus 2024: Which Ad Blocker Is Right for You?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdClear Review 2024: Is This Free Ad Blocker for Android Users Worth It?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrustnav Review 2024: A Good Free Ad Blocker\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Best Surfshark VPN Alternatives of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNordVPN vs. Total VPN 2024: Secure Streaming vs. Ultimate Browsing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s a Sneak Peek at the New Apple Passwords App [June 2024]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAS SEEN ON\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore Popular Topics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAntivirus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVPN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPassword Managers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAd Blockers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentity Theft\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Copyright © 2024  All About Cookies  111 E.

ADA compliance means ensuring accessibility for individuals with disabilities, which can include visual, auditory, and physical impairments. Failing to make a website accessible can lead to legal liabilities and loss of potential clients.\\n\\nIn addition to legal and ethical considerations, maintaining ADA compliance helps to create an inclusive environment and promote diversity.

We encourage you to learn about third parties‚Äô privacy and security policies before providing them with information. 7.

Your California Privacy Rights We will not share any Personal Data with third-parties for their direct marketing purposes to the extent prohibited by California law. If our practices change, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws and will notify you in advance. 9. Interest Based Advertising Interest based advertising is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order to predict an individual‚Äôs preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.  We work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be interested in the Brightr Travel products or services so that we can send them promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them on the websites and mobile apps of other entities.  These third parties include: (a) advertising networks, which collect information about a person‚Äôs interests when that person views or interacts with one of their advertisements; (2) attribution partners, which measure the effectiveness of certain advertisements; and (3) business partners, which collect information when a person views or interacts with one of their advertisements.  In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them. Individuals may submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties. We may use special tools that are commonly used for this purpose, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile advertising IDs, flash cookies, and similar technologies. We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.  The information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in response to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties‚Äô platforms.  We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others. We, or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites; to present more personalized content; to provide more useful and relevant ads - for example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you the same ones repeatedly; to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites and Sites, or to display or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a person‚Äôs perceived interest in products or services similar to those that we offer.  Our interest-based ads may be served to you in emails or on third-party platforms. We may serve these ads about our products or services or send commercial communications directly ourselves or through these third parties.  Visitors may opt out of receiving interest based advertising by advertising networks that may be delivered to them on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers; and http://www.networkadvertising.org. These features will opt a Visitor out of many ‚Äì but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. 10. Do Not Track Policy California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals.  In the meantime, you may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites. If you want to opt out of this online behavioral advertising, visit the following sites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers and http://www.networkadvertising.org.  This will opt you out of many ‚Äì but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. Choices you make may be browser and device specific. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or a different computer or device, you may need to update your opt-out choices. Other third-party Sites provide visitors with the ability to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on their Sites that you need to control through your settings on that Site. For example, to opt out of Google‚Äôs use of your online behavior for advertising purposes, visit Google‚Äôs Ad Settings page. 11. Third Party Cookies California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose whether other third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual\\'s online activities from their site or service. We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Site. These third parties include (1) business partners, which collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Site; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements.  The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or promotional material on this Site and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.  The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based advertisements on the Services have limited access to a small amount of information about your profile and your device, which is necessary to serve you advertisements that are tailored to your apparent interests. It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or services.  We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify you (such as email address); however, these third parties may have access to information about your device (such as IP or MAC address). We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Other than as discussed in this document, we have no control over these third parties.  11.1 The Following Types of Cookies Are Used in the Site:  ‚Ä¢ strictly necessary/essential cookies - These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website.

They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator‚Äôs permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation. 12. Minors and Children‚Äôs Privacy Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that Personal Data has been collected on the Service from persons under 18 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 18 years of age has obtained an Account on the Service, then you may alert us at support@gobeacon.me and request that we delete that child‚Äôs Personal Data from our systems.

To the extent that a minor has posted such content on the Service, the minor has the right to have this content deleted or removed using the deletion or removal options detailed in this Privacy Policy. If you have any question regarding this topic, please contact us as indicated in the ‚ÄúHow to Contact Us‚Äù section. Please be aware that, although we offer this deletion capability, the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information. 13. Data Security We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the ‚ÄúHow to Contact Us‚Äù section.  If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law. 14. Data Retention We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User‚Äôs account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:  ‚Ä¢ the contents of closed accounts are deleted within 3 months of the date of closure;  ‚Ä¢ backups are kept for 3 months;  ‚Ä¢ billing information is retained for a period of 7 years as of their provision to Brightr Travel in accordance with the Estonian accounting and taxation laws  ‚Ä¢ information on legal transactions between Client and Brightr Travel is retained for a period of 10 years as of their provision to Brightr Travel in accordance with the general limitation period set for civil claims in the Estonian General Part of the Civil Code Act 15. Settings Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain Personal Data, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service. We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. 16. Data Transfer We may transfer, process and store Personal Data we collect through the Services in centralized databases and with service providers located in the U.S. The U.S. may not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services. When we transfer Personal Data to the U.S., we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy.  The Service is hosted in the United States. EU customers‚Äô databases will be hosted with HiVelocity located in Atlanta, Georgia. Regardless of the database being hosted in the USA, if you choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you may be transferring your Client Data and Personal Data outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing by our service providers listed in the Brightr Travel Terms of Service. We will comply with GDPR requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S. Also, we may transfer your data to the U.S., the EEA, or other countries or regions deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection of personal data in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. 17. Data Controller and Data Processor Brightr Travel does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User via the Service. Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data. Brightr Travel is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users.  Because Brightr Travel does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Brightr Travel is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter ‚ÄúGDPR‚Äù) and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR. Brightr Travel should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Brightr Travel does not independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Brightr Travel in connection with Brightr Travel‚Äôs provision of Services to Clients. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.  The Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.  Brightr Travel is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors‚Äô servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is Brightr Travel responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information. 18. Changes and Updates to this Policy Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time. If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision, and will comply with applicable law. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy. 19. How to Contact Us Please contact us with any questions or comments about this Policy, your Personal Data, our use and disclosure practices, or your consent choices by email at support@gobeacon.me.

They are used by web developers to help users navigate their websites efficiently and perform certain functions.\\nDue to their core role of enhancing/enabling usability or site processes, disabling cookies may prevent users from using certain websites.\\n\\n\\n\\nCookies are created when a user\\'s browser loads a particular website. The website sends information to the browser which then creates a text file.\\nEvery time the user goes back to the same website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the website\\'s server.\\nComputer cookies are created not just by the website the user is browsing but also by other websites that run ads, widgets, or other elements on the page being loaded.\\nThese cookies regulate how the ads appear or how the widgets and other elements function on the page.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more about managing cookies on different browsers.\\nStandard uses for browser cookies\\nWebsite servers set cookies to help authenticate the user if the user logs in to a secure area of the website. Login information is stored in a cookie so the user can enter and leave the website without having to re-enter the same authentication information over and over.\\nSession cookies are also used by the server to store information about user page activities so users can easily pick up where they left off on the server\\'s pages. By default, web pages really don\\'t have any \\'memory\\'. Cookies tell the server what pages to show the user so the user doesn\\'t have to remember or start navigating the site all over again.\\nCookies act as a sort of “bookmark” within the site. Similarly, cookies can store ordering information needed to make shopping carts work instead of forcing the user to remember all the items the user put in the shopping cart.\\nPersistent or tracking cookies are also employed to store user preferences. Many websites allow the user to customize how information is presented through site layouts or themes. These changes make the site easier to navigate and/or let the user leave a part of the user\\'s “personality” at the site.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more about the different types of cookies.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Team\\'s Latest Research\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeaving Behind Your Logins: More Than Half of Internet Users Don’t Plan for the Unexpected [Study]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAd Blocker Adoption: Majority of Americans Block Ads — Do They Feel Bad About It?

Cookies use a plain text format. They are not compiled pieces of code so they cannot be executed nor are they self-executing. Accordingly, they cannot make copies of themselves and spread to other networks to execute and replicate again.\\nSince they cannot perform these functions, they fall outside the standard virus definition.\\nCookies CAN be used for malicious purposes though. Since they store information about a user\\'s browsing preferences and history, both on a specific site and browsing among several sites, cookies can be used to act as a form of spyware.\\nMany anti-spyware products are well aware of this problem and routinely flag cookies as candidates for deletion after standard virus and/or spyware scans. See here for some privacy issues and concerns.\\nThe way responsible and ethical web developers deal with privacy issues caused by cookie tracking is by including clear descriptions of how cookies are deployed on their site.\\nIf you are a web developer and need advice on the implementation of cookies and a privacy policy, you can contact us by the inquiry form at the bottom of the page.\\nThese privacy policies should explain what kind of information is collected and how the information is used. Organizations utilizing and displaying a proper and useful cookie policy and privacy policy include\\xa0LinkedIn\\xa0and\\xa0Networkadvertising.org.\\nMost browsers have built-in privacy settings that provide differing levels of cookie acceptance, expiration time, and disposal after a user has visited a particular site. Backing up your computer\\xa0can give you the peace of mind that your files are safe.\\nComputer cookies help\\nComputer cookies make our experience on the internet easier, quicker, and much less complicated.\\nImagine trying to log in to your favorite website, social media account, or email and having to remember and type in your username and password every time — it would be almost impossible. Just to cope and make it easier you would probably start using the same username and password for every account which would be very dangerous and compromise your cybersecurity cookies are essential for internet surfing.\\nThey help you and they help the website owner by helping to know their audience and customer.\\nCookies help identify and recognize that it\\'s you and allow you quick entry and they also help the website owner to identify the bad and malicious visitors who may be bots trying to enforce their way into the code of the website looking for vulnerabilities to place malicious and hijacking code that will give you malware.\\nCookies don\\'t identify you personally and they can\\'t tell who you are but they can remember the device you are using and thus make it simpler for you to use.\\nOther cookie-based threats\\nSince identity protection is highly valued and is every internet user\\'s right, it pays to be aware of what threat cookies can pose.\\nAs cookies are transmitted back and forth between a browser and website, if an attacker or unauthorized person gets in between the data transmission, the sensitive cookie information can be intercepted.\\nAlthough relatively rare, this can happen if the browser is connecting to the server using an unencrypted network like a non-secured Wi-Fi channel.\\nInternet security is only attainable if you regularly use an antivirus protection program.\\nOther cookie-based attacks involve exploiting faulty cookie-setting systems on servers. If a website doesn\\'t require browsers to use encrypted channels only, attackers can use this vulnerability to trick browsers into sending sensitive information over insecure channels.\\nThe attackers then siphon off the sensitive data for unauthorized access purposes.\\nNew laws for the use of cookies and other technologies that store online user information\\nOn May 25, 2018, a set of new European privacy laws called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect.\\nRather than the \"Opt out\" option for website visitors, websites will need to specifically gain the consent of their visitors and they must \"Opt In\" to be able to store cookies on their computer or other devices.\\nThis is expected to be difficult to manage and enforcement will more than likely be done subtlely and with encouragement rather than with the threat of fines and penalties.\\nBusinesses in the EU have some great resources that can help them with their cookie compliance. The European Union has an\\xa0internet handbook\\xa0that explains to businesses their requirements under the legislation and has a \\'cookie kit\" to help them comply.\\nIn 2018, California also signed new privacy regulations under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Similar to the GDPR, the CCPA was created to protect consumers’ personal data and give businesses a set of standards to follow with regards to that data. Businesses must disclose what personal information is being collected and sold about their users. Users have the right to request that businesses delete their data and the right to opt out of data collection. The CCPA went into effect January 1, 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat does the new law say?\\nUnder the GDPR, the new requirement is essentially that cookies can only be placed on machines where the user or subscriber has given their consent.\\n6 (1) Subject to paragraph (4), a person shall not store or gain access to information stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user unless the requirements of paragraph (2) are met.(2) The requirements are that the subscriber or user of that terminal equipment-- (a) is provided with clear and comprehensive information about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, that information; and (b) has given his or her consent.(3) Where an electronic communications network is used by the same person to store or access information in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user on more than one occasion, it is sufficient for the purposes of this regulation that the requirements of paragraph (2) are met in respect of the initial use.(3a) For the purposes of paragraph (2), consent may be signified by a subscriber who amends or sets controls on the internet browser which the subscriber uses or by using another application or program to signify consent.(4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the technical storage of, or access to, information-- (a) for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network; or (b) where such storage or access is strictly necessary for the provision of an information society service requested by the subscriber or user.\\nMore information on the new changes can be found here.\\nKey tips for safe and responsible cookie-based web browsing\\nDue to their flexibility and the fact that many of the largest and most-visited websites use cookies by default, cookies are almost unavoidable. Disabling cookies will lock a user out of many of the most widely-used sites on the Internet like Youtube, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and others.\\nEven search settings require cookies for language settings. Here are some tips you can use to ensure worry-free cookie-based browsing:\\nCustomize your browser\\'s cookie settings to reflect your comfort level with cookie security or use our guide to delete cookies.\\nIf you are very comfortable with cookies and you are the only person using your computer, you may want to set long expiration time frames for storing your personal access information and browsing history.\\nIf you share access on your computer, you may want to set your browser to clear private browsing data every time you close your browser.\\nWhile not as secure as rejecting cookies outright, this option lets you access cookie-based websites while deleting any sensitive information after your browsing session.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstall and keep antispyware applications updated\\nMany spyware detection, cleanup applications, and spyware removers include attack site detection. They block your browser from accessing websites designed to exploit browser vulnerabilities or download malicious software. \\nMake sure your browser is updated\\nIf you haven\\'t already, set your browser to update automatically. This eliminates security vulnerabilities caused by outdated browsers. Many cookie-based exploits are based on exploiting older browsers\\' security shortcomings. \\nCookies are everywhere and can\\'t really be avoided if you wish to enjoy the biggest and best websites out there. With a clear understanding of how they operate and how they help your browsing experience, you can take the necessary security measures to ensure that you browse the Net confidently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManaging mobile cookies and security\\nThe mobile landscape is so much broader than a single platform.\\nWe cover mobile cookie use plus cybersecurity issues that can be found in the mobile sector.\\nKnowing how to safely surf the web is one of the most important aspects of personal cyber security and education is one of the most powerful tools. \\nIncluded below are a few points to keep in mind when using your Android/iPhone (or any mobile device) to ensure that you are safe and secure on the web.\\n\\nCookies are just text files that store information about your computer or mobile device. These cookies can be necessary for the website to operate and function.\\nBe skeptical! Always research a program or application before installation. Research the application and the app developer to establish credibility. Review the product/developer website for customer support phone numbers or emails and review the social media pages to see what people are saying about the product.\\nAvoid downloading apps or programs that found you. If you did not actively seek a program then avoid installing apps from pushy ads or automatic downloads.\\nStay current with application and operating system updates. Updates often include security patches that are designed to fix newly discovered vulnerabilities.\\nInstall and USE an antivirus application to protect you from threats that slip past your personal defense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest Stories\\n\\nSee More Stories →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurfshark VPN vs. StrongVPN 2024: Which One Offers the Best Value?\\nFind out if Surfshark’s feature-rich, budget-friendly service or StrongVPN’s straightforward, reliable protection is the right choice for your online privacy needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorton vs. Aura Antivirus 2024: Can A Vintage Antivirus Stand Up to a Newcomer?\\nNorton and Aura antivirus solutions look similar on the surface but a few key differences will help you decide what you need in your security provider.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nuBlock Origin vs. Adblock Plus 2024: Which Ad Blocker Is Right for You?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdClear Review 2024: Is This Free Ad Blocker for Android Users Worth It?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrustnav Review 2024: A Good Free Ad Blocker\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Best Surfshark VPN Alternatives of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNordVPN vs. Total VPN 2024: Secure Streaming vs. Ultimate Browsing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s a Sneak Peek at the New Apple Passwords App [June 2024]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAS SEEN ON\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore Popular Topics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAntivirus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVPN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPassword Managers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAd Blockers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentity Theft\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Copyright © 2024  All About Cookies  111 E.

ADA compliance means ensuring accessibility for individuals with disabilities, which can include visual, auditory, and physical impairments. Failing to make a website accessible can lead to legal liabilities and loss of potential clients.\\n\\nIn addition to legal and ethical considerations, maintaining ADA compliance helps to create an inclusive environment and promote diversity. Small businesses can achieve ADA compliance through simple measures such as adding alternative text to images, using descriptive page titles, and providing clear navigation. Investing in ADA compliance not only benefits individuals with disabilities, but also demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and attracts a wider customer base. By embracing accessibility, small businesses can thrive in the digital economy and make a positive impact on society.\\n\\u200b\\nCheck out this website for all the information you need to learn and\\xa0Get Started!\\xa0HOMEEXPLOREMEMBERSABOUT25TH ANNIVERSARYMHMS \"CLOSE UP\"CONTACTRESOURCESMoreUse tab to navigate through the menu items.bottom of page\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://www.missionhillmainstreet.com/resources', 'title': 'RESOURCES | MHMS - Mission Hill', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

Third-Party Services The Service may contain features or links to web sites and services provided by third parties. Any information you provide on third-party sites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operators‚Äô policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Service. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Service. We encourage you to learn about third parties‚Äô privacy and security policies before providing them with information. 7. Privacy Shield Brightr Travel‚Äôs US entity has applied to be certified under the Privacy Shield framework. Once this process is complete, we will provide a statement of compliance in this section of our Privacy Policy. 8. Your California Privacy Rights We will not share any Personal Data with third-parties for their direct marketing purposes to the extent prohibited by California law. If our practices change, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws and will notify you in advance. 9. Interest Based Advertising Interest based advertising is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order to predict an individual‚Äôs preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.  We work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be interested in the Brightr Travel products or services so that we can send them promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them on the websites and mobile apps of other entities.  These third parties include: (a) advertising networks, which collect information about a person‚Äôs interests when that person views or interacts with one of their advertisements; (2) attribution partners, which measure the effectiveness of certain advertisements; and (3) business partners, which collect information when a person views or interacts with one of their advertisements.  In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them. Individuals may submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties. We may use special tools that are commonly used for this purpose, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile advertising IDs, flash cookies, and similar technologies. We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.  The information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in response to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties‚Äô platforms.  We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others. We, or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites; to present more personalized content; to provide more useful and relevant ads - for example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you the same ones repeatedly; to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites and Sites, or to display or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a person‚Äôs perceived interest in products or services similar to those that we offer.  Our interest-based ads may be served to you in emails or on third-party platforms. We may serve these ads about our products or services or send commercial communications directly ourselves or through these third parties.  Visitors may opt out of receiving interest based advertising by advertising networks that may be delivered to them on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers; and http://www.networkadvertising.org. These features will opt a Visitor out of many ‚Äì but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. 10. Do Not Track Policy California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals.  In the meantime, you may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites. If you want to opt out of this online behavioral advertising, visit the following sites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers and http://www.networkadvertising.org.  This will opt you out of many ‚Äì but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. Choices you make may be browser and device specific. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or a different computer or device, you may need to update your opt-out choices. Other third-party Sites provide visitors with the ability to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on their Sites that you need to control through your settings on that Site. For example, to opt out of Google‚Äôs use of your online behavior for advertising purposes, visit Google‚Äôs Ad Settings page. 11. Third Party Cookies California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose whether other third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual\\'s online activities from their site or service. We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Site. These third parties include (1) business partners, which collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Site; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements.  The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or promotional material on this Site and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.  The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based advertisements on the Services have limited access to a small amount of information about your profile and your device, which is necessary to serve you advertisements that are tailored to your apparent interests. It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or services.  We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify you (such as email address); however, these third parties may have access to information about your device (such as IP or MAC address). We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Other than as discussed in this document, we have no control over these third parties.  11.1 The Following Types of Cookies Are Used in the Site:  ‚Ä¢ strictly necessary/essential cookies - These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website.

They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator‚Äôs permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation. 12. Minors and Children‚Äôs Privacy Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that Personal Data has been collected on the Service from persons under 18 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

Please be aware that, although we offer this deletion capability, the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information. 13. Data Security We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the ‚ÄúHow to Contact Us‚Äù section.  If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law. 14. Data Retention We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User‚Äôs account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:  ‚Ä¢ the contents of closed accounts are deleted within 3 months of the date of closure;  ‚Ä¢ backups are kept for 3 months;  ‚Ä¢ billing information is retained for a period of 7 years as of their provision to Brightr Travel in accordance with the Estonian accounting and taxation laws  ‚Ä¢ information on legal transactions between Client and Brightr Travel is retained for a period of 10 years as of their provision to Brightr Travel in accordance with the general limitation period set for civil claims in the Estonian General Part of the Civil Code Act 15. Settings Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain Personal Data, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service. We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. 16. Data Transfer We may transfer, process and store Personal Data we collect through the Services in centralized databases and with service providers located in the U.S. The U.S. may not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services. When we transfer Personal Data to the U.S., we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy.  The Service is hosted in the United States. EU customers‚Äô databases will be hosted with HiVelocity located in Atlanta, Georgia. Regardless of the database being hosted in the USA, if you choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you may be transferring your Client Data and Personal Data outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing by our service providers listed in the Brightr Travel Terms of Service. We will comply with GDPR requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S. Also, we may transfer your data to the U.S., the EEA, or other countries or regions deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection of personal data in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. 17. Data Controller and Data Processor Brightr Travel does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User via the Service. Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data. Brightr Travel is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users.  Because Brightr Travel does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Brightr Travel is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter ‚ÄúGDPR‚Äù) and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR. Brightr Travel should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Brightr Travel does not independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Brightr Travel in connection with Brightr Travel‚Äôs provision of Services to Clients. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.  The Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.  Brightr Travel is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors‚Äô servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is Brightr Travel responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information. 18. Changes and Updates to this Policy Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time. If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision, and will comply with applicable law. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy. 19.

They are used by web developers to help users navigate their websites efficiently and perform certain functions.\\nDue to their core role of enhancing/enabling usability or site processes, disabling cookies may prevent users from using certain websites.\\n\\n\\n\\nCookies are created when a user\\'s browser loads a particular website. The website sends information to the browser which then creates a text file.\\nEvery time the user goes back to the same website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the website\\'s server.\\nComputer cookies are created not just by the website the user is browsing but also by other websites that run ads, widgets, or other elements on the page being loaded.\\nThese cookies regulate how the ads appear or how the widgets and other elements function on the page.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more about managing cookies on different browsers.\\nStandard uses for browser cookies\\nWebsite servers set cookies to help authenticate the user if the user logs in to a secure area of the website. Login information is stored in a cookie so the user can enter and leave the website without having to re-enter the same authentication information over and over.\\nSession cookies are also used by the server to store information about user page activities so users can easily pick up where they left off on the server\\'s pages. By default, web pages really don\\'t have any \\'memory\\'. Cookies tell the server what pages to show the user so the user doesn\\'t have to remember or start navigating the site all over again.\\nCookies act as a sort of “bookmark” within the site. Similarly, cookies can store ordering information needed to make shopping carts work instead of forcing the user to remember all the items the user put in the shopping cart.\\nPersistent or tracking cookies are also employed to store user preferences. Many websites allow the user to customize how information is presented through site layouts or themes. These changes make the site easier to navigate and/or let the user leave a part of the user\\'s “personality” at the site.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more about the different types of cookies.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Team\\'s Latest Research\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeaving Behind Your Logins: More Than Half of Internet Users Don’t Plan for the Unexpected [Study]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAd Blocker Adoption: Majority of Americans Block Ads — Do They Feel Bad About It?

Cookies use a plain text format. They are not compiled pieces of code so they cannot be executed nor are they self-executing. Accordingly, they cannot make copies of themselves and spread to other networks to execute and replicate again.\\nSince they cannot perform these functions, they fall outside the standard virus definition.\\nCookies CAN be used for malicious purposes though. Since they store information about a user\\'s browsing preferences and history, both on a specific site and browsing among several sites, cookies can be used to act as a form of spyware.\\nMany anti-spyware products are well aware of this problem and routinely flag cookies as candidates for deletion after standard virus and/or spyware scans. See here for some privacy issues and concerns.\\nThe way responsible and ethical web developers deal with privacy issues caused by cookie tracking is by including clear descriptions of how cookies are deployed on their site.\\nIf you are a web developer and need advice on the implementation of cookies and a privacy policy, you can contact us by the inquiry form at the bottom of the page.\\nThese privacy policies should explain what kind of information is collected and how the information is used. Organizations utilizing and displaying a proper and useful cookie policy and privacy policy include\\xa0LinkedIn\\xa0and\\xa0Networkadvertising.org.\\nMost browsers have built-in privacy settings that provide differing levels of cookie acceptance, expiration time, and disposal after a user has visited a particular site. Backing up your computer\\xa0can give you the peace of mind that your files are safe.\\nComputer cookies help\\nComputer cookies make our experience on the internet easier, quicker, and much less complicated.\\nImagine trying to log in to your favorite website, social media account, or email and having to remember and type in your username and password every time — it would be almost impossible. Just to cope and make it easier you would probably start using the same username and password for every account which would be very dangerous and compromise your cybersecurity cookies are essential for internet surfing.\\nThey help you and they help the website owner by helping to know their audience and customer.\\nCookies help identify and recognize that it\\'s you and allow you quick entry and they also help the website owner to identify the bad and malicious visitors who may be bots trying to enforce their way into the code of the website looking for vulnerabilities to place malicious and hijacking code that will give you malware.\\nCookies don\\'t identify you personally and they can\\'t tell who you are but they can remember the device you are using and thus make it simpler for you to use.\\nOther cookie-based threats\\nSince identity protection is highly valued and is every internet user\\'s right, it pays to be aware of what threat cookies can pose.\\nAs cookies are transmitted back and forth between a browser and website, if an attacker or unauthorized person gets in between the data transmission, the sensitive cookie information can be intercepted.\\nAlthough relatively rare, this can happen if the browser is connecting to the server using an unencrypted network like a non-secured Wi-Fi channel.\\nInternet security is only attainable if you regularly use an antivirus protection program.\\nOther cookie-based attacks involve exploiting faulty cookie-setting systems on servers. If a website doesn\\'t require browsers to use encrypted channels only, attackers can use this vulnerability to trick browsers into sending sensitive information over insecure channels.\\nThe attackers then siphon off the sensitive data for unauthorized access purposes.\\nNew laws for the use of cookies and other technologies that store online user information\\nOn May 25, 2018, a set of new European privacy laws called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect.\\nRather than the \"Opt out\" option for website visitors, websites will need to specifically gain the consent of their visitors and they must \"Opt In\" to be able to store cookies on their computer or other devices.\\nThis is expected to be difficult to manage and enforcement will more than likely be done subtlely and with encouragement rather than with the threat of fines and penalties.\\nBusinesses in the EU have some great resources that can help them with their cookie compliance. The European Union has an\\xa0internet handbook\\xa0that explains to businesses their requirements under the legislation and has a \\'cookie kit\" to help them comply.\\nIn 2018, California also signed new privacy regulations under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Similar to the GDPR, the CCPA was created to protect consumers’ personal data and give businesses a set of standards to follow with regards to that data. Businesses must disclose what personal information is being collected and sold about their users. Users have the right to request that businesses delete their data and the right to opt out of data collection. The CCPA went into effect January 1, 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat does the new law say?\\nUnder the GDPR, the new requirement is essentially that cookies can only be placed on machines where the user or subscriber has given their consent.\\n6 (1) Subject to paragraph (4), a person shall not store or gain access to information stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user unless the requirements of paragraph (2) are met.(2) The requirements are that the subscriber or user of that terminal equipment-- (a) is provided with clear and comprehensive information about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, that information; and (b) has given his or her consent.(3) Where an electronic communications network is used by the same person to store or access information in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user on more than one occasion, it is sufficient for the purposes of this regulation that the requirements of paragraph (2) are met in respect of the initial use.(3a) For the purposes of paragraph (2), consent may be signified by a subscriber who amends or sets controls on the internet browser which the subscriber uses or by using another application or program to signify consent.(4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the technical storage of, or access to, information-- (a) for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network; or (b) where such storage or access is strictly necessary for the provision of an information society service requested by the subscriber or user.\\nMore information on the new changes can be found here.\\nKey tips for safe and responsible cookie-based web browsing\\nDue to their flexibility and the fact that many of the largest and most-visited websites use cookies by default, cookies are almost unavoidable. Disabling cookies will lock a user out of many of the most widely-used sites on the Internet like Youtube, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and others.\\nEven search settings require cookies for language settings. Here are some tips you can use to ensure worry-free cookie-based browsing:\\nCustomize your browser\\'s cookie settings to reflect your comfort level with cookie security or use our guide to delete cookies.\\nIf you are very comfortable with cookies and you are the only person using your computer, you may want to set long expiration time frames for storing your personal access information and browsing history.\\nIf you share access on your computer, you may want to set your browser to clear private browsing data every time you close your browser.\\nWhile not as secure as rejecting cookies outright, this option lets you access cookie-based websites while deleting any sensitive information after your browsing session.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstall and keep antispyware applications updated\\nMany spyware detection, cleanup applications, and spyware removers include attack site detection. They block your browser from accessing websites designed to exploit browser vulnerabilities or download malicious software. \\nMake sure your browser is updated\\nIf you haven\\'t already, set your browser to update automatically. This eliminates security vulnerabilities caused by outdated browsers. Many cookie-based exploits are based on exploiting older browsers\\' security shortcomings. \\nCookies are everywhere and can\\'t really be avoided if you wish to enjoy the biggest and best websites out there. With a clear understanding of how they operate and how they help your browsing experience, you can take the necessary security measures to ensure that you browse the Net confidently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManaging mobile cookies and security\\nThe mobile landscape is so much broader than a single platform.\\nWe cover mobile cookie use plus cybersecurity issues that can be found in the mobile sector.\\nKnowing how to safely surf the web is one of the most important aspects of personal cyber security and education is one of the most powerful tools. \\nIncluded below are a few points to keep in mind when using your Android/iPhone (or any mobile device) to ensure that you are safe and secure on the web.\\n\\nCookies are just text files that store information about your computer or mobile device. These cookies can be necessary for the website to operate and function.\\nBe skeptical! Always research a program or application before installation. Research the application and the app developer to establish credibility. Review the product/developer website for customer support phone numbers or emails and review the social media pages to see what people are saying about the product.\\nAvoid downloading apps or programs that found you. If you did not actively seek a program then avoid installing apps from pushy ads or automatic downloads.\\nStay current with application and operating system updates. Updates often include security patches that are designed to fix newly discovered vulnerabilities.\\nInstall and USE an antivirus application to protect you from threats that slip past your personal defense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest Stories\\n\\nSee More Stories →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurfshark VPN vs. StrongVPN 2024: Which One Offers the Best Value?\\nFind out if Surfshark’s feature-rich, budget-friendly service or StrongVPN’s straightforward, reliable protection is the right choice for your online privacy needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorton vs. Aura Antivirus 2024: Can A Vintage Antivirus Stand Up to a Newcomer?\\nNorton and Aura antivirus solutions look similar on the surface but a few key differences will help you decide what you need in your security provider.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nuBlock Origin vs. Adblock Plus 2024: Which Ad Blocker Is Right for You?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdClear Review 2024: Is This Free Ad Blocker for Android Users Worth It?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrustnav Review 2024: A Good Free Ad Blocker\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Best Surfshark VPN Alternatives of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNordVPN vs. Total VPN 2024: Secure Streaming vs. Ultimate Browsing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s a Sneak Peek at the New Apple Passwords App [June 2024]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAS SEEN ON\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore Popular Topics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAntivirus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVPN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPassword Managers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAd Blockers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentity Theft\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuides and Tips\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Copyright © 2024  All About Cookies  111 E.

ADA compliance means ensuring accessibility for individuals with disabilities, which can include visual, auditory, and physical impairments. Failing to make a website accessible can lead to legal liabilities and loss of potential clients.\\n\\nIn addition to legal and ethical considerations, maintaining ADA compliance helps to create an inclusive environment and promote diversity. Small businesses can achieve ADA compliance through simple measures such as adding alternative text to images, using descriptive page titles, and providing clear navigation. Investing in ADA compliance not only benefits individuals with disabilities, but also demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and attracts a wider customer base. By embracing accessibility, small businesses can thrive in the digital economy and make a positive impact on society.\\n\\u200b\\nCheck out this website for all the information you need to learn and\\xa0Get Started!\\xa0HOMEEXPLOREMEMBERSABOUT25TH ANNIVERSARYMHMS \"CLOSE UP\"CONTACTRESOURCESMoreUse tab to navigate through the menu items.bottom of page\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://www.missionhillmainstreet.com/resources', 'title': 'RESOURCES | MHMS - Mission Hill', 'language': 'en'}),\n",
