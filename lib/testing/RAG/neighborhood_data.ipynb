Situated on one of the world's finest natural harbors,\\n      Boston was once the maritime capital of the colonial United States. Known\\n      variously as the birthplace of the American Revolution, the site of New\\n      England's largest fleet of clipper ships, meeting place of\\n      America's literati, and home of many venerable educational and\\n      cultural institutions, Boston remains the largest city in the six New\\n      England states. During the 1980s, Boston gained fame as a high technology\\n      and defense research center, as well as a good place in which to conduct\\n      business. This was in part attributable to the vast network of research\\n      facilities connected with schools in the region. Since the economic\\n      downturn that occurred in 1988 through 1992, the city has been enjoying an\\n      economic recovery, with several large ongoing projects that will improve\\n      its infrastructure, including the famous (or to some, infamous) Big Dig.\\n      The city remains one of the country's premier tourist attractions.\\n      In recent years, various sources have ranked Boston among the best large\\n      cities in which to live in the United States.

As in many places across the country, Boston\\'s economy was\\n      affected by the events on September 11, 2001. Especially hit were the\\n      travel, financial services and high technology sectors, which alone lost\\n      nearly 32,000 jobs between 2001 and 2003. Loss of jobs in those areas\\n      leveled off in 2004 and began to regain some lost ground, especially in\\n      tourism. Other sectors such as education and health care were not as hard hit.\\n      While manufacturing in Boston has lost some ground, it remains an\\n      important sector of the economy and is joined by several other traditional\\n      industries and some new ones. Boston is considered one of the top places\\n      in which to do business in the United States. Major industries include\\n      finance, high-technology research and development, tourism, medicine,\\n      education, commercial fishing, food processing, printing and publishing,\\n      and government. Early in its history, Boston made its name as a center for the processing\\n      of wool and the manufacture of clothing, textiles, shoes, and leather\\n      goods. While the shoe and textile industries have suffered in recent\\n      decades, they remain significant contributors to Boston\\'s economy. In the last 20 years, city employment continued to shift from traditional\\n      labor intensive manufacturing jobs to technology and service jobs. The\\n      economy of metropolitan Boston now primarily rests on high technology,\\n      finance, professional and business services, defense, and educational and\\n      medical institutions. The city\\'s economy is more specialized in the\\n      financial, business and professional services and educational and medical\\n      sectors than the suburban economy, which is more specialized in high\\n      technology and the defense industry. Boston\\'s financial district includes major banks such as Fleet\\n      Bank, purchased in 2004 by Bank of America, and investment firms like\\n      Fidelity Investments. Insurance firms such as John Hancock Financial\\n      Services are also a significant presence. Boston is one of the country\\'s top 10 tourist attractions, focusing\\n      on the city\\'s 62 historic sites, its nearly 2,000 restaurants, and\\n      its hundreds of hotels. Tourism is a year-round\\n       industry in Boston, which hosted 16.3 million visitors in 2004, spending\\n      $7.9 billion. The medical schools of both Tufts University and Harvard University are\\n      located in Boston, as is Massachusetts General Hospital, the major\\n      teaching hospital for both schools. Education is a thriving segment of\\n      Boston\\'s economy; within the city limits are 10 colleges and\\n      universities, 6 technical schools, 4 art and music schools, and 6 junior\\n      colleges. In towns and suburbs surrounding Boston, educational\\n      institutions include many prestigious secondary and boarding schools. More than two million pounds of fish are caught in the waters in and\\n      around Boston each year, making fishing, food processing, and food storage\\n      prime industries. Boston is one of the nation\\'s foremost fishing\\n      port and wool market. Both large and small printing operations employ\\n      thousands of workers in the metropolitan area. Boston\\'s print fare\\n      includes several national magazines, scholarly and technical journals, and\\n      the Christian Science publications. For years, Boston has been home to the Atlantic Monthly, one of the oldest literary publications in the United States. As the capital of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Boston is the\\n      workplace of many state and municipal employees. Items and goods produced: machinery, medical and navigational instruments, chemicals, metals,\\n      rubber products and clothing, computers, software, missiles and missile\\n      guidance systems, ships, shoes and boots, textiles. Incentive Programs—New and Existing Companies Local programs Boston\\'s Office of Business Development provides key resources to\\n      support small business development. The office offers a full range of\\n      services—from financial and referral services to business facade\\n      improvement to site finder services—so that each business owner\\n      receives whatever help is needed. Businesses may obtain loans through the\\n      Boston Local Development Corporation, and financing through the Boston\\n      Industrial Development Financing Authority, which issues bonds to finance\\n      the capital needs of Boston businesses. ReStore Boston provides grants and\\n      loans to renovate store fronts, and provides architectural assistance to\\n      do so. The office also has a free Commercial Space for Lease finding\\n      service. State programs The Massachusetts Business Resource Team, under the Executive Office of\\n      Economic Development, exists to help businesses relocate to the state,\\n      expansion of existing businesses, and creation of new businesses. For new\\n      companies, there are Small Business Development Centers in Boston and\\n      across Massachusetts, which advise and educate entrepreneurs. The Capital\\n      Access Program helps businesses secure loans from approved banks.\\n      Expanding or relocating businesses can take advantage of a 3 percent\\n      investment tax credit against the corporate excise tax for the\\n      construction of manufacturing facilities, or the purchase or lease of\\n      equipment. Businesses moving to an \"economic opportunity\\n      area\" or an \"economically distressed area\" have\\n      access to special tax credits and incentive programs. For manufacturers\\n      looking for working capital, the Economic Stabilization Trust can provide\\n      funds to help get the business on the road to recovery. For businesses\\n      willing to move or expand into brownfield areas, Massachusetts provides\\n      low cost assessment and remediation programs, and alternative financing\\n      options. Technology firms can receive assistance with the Research and\\n      Development Tax Credit and the Emerging Technology fund, which provides\\n      loans for specialized equipment purchases and R & D,, and\\n      biotechnology companies can receive funds for new job creation through the\\n      Jobs Creation Incentive Payment. All businesses can take advantage of\\n      Safety Training grants for education to improve workplace safety. The\\n      Massachusetts Export Center provides counseling, education and technical\\n      assistance for businesses in global markets. For business involved in the\\n      fishing industry, Seafood Loans assist in the construction or renovations\\n      of buildings or equipment. Job training programs Boston\\'s Office of Jobs and Community Service (JCS) receives\\n      funding from the U.S. Department of Labor, HUD, and the Massachusetts\\n      Departments of Education and Transitional Assistance. The state provides\\n      matching grants from the Workplace Training Fund to pay for employee\\n      training. The state\\'s 32 One-Stop Career Centers provide job\\n      finding assistance and career counseling for potential employees; and\\n      listing services, job fairs, and recruiting assistance for employers. JCS\\n      provides planning and oversight to a large network of community-based\\n      organizations who provide residents with a rich variety of training\\n      programs. These include basic education, GED and diploma programs, English\\n      as a Second Language, job readiness, and a variety of skills training.\\n      Additionally, JCS is a partner in a one-stop career center called The Work\\n      Place, which coordinates the functions of the Boston Neighborhood Jobs\\n      Trust, oversees various human service programs, and houses Read Boston, a\\n      major literacy initiative to ensure that all children are\\n      reading-proficient by the third grade. There are incentive grants for\\n      training when hiring an unemployed worker, or someone receiving public\\n      assistance. Development Projects The real estate market in Boston continues to thrive with multi-million\\n      dollar projects. A special focus is development of the South Boston\\n      Waterfront area, and the Fort Point Channel Arts District. Artists for\\n      Humanity has a new \"green,\" environmentally-aware 23,500\\n      square foot center providing studio and gallery space for teaching art to\\n      inner-city youth. In 2006, construction will begin on a 22,000\\n       square foot addition to Boston\\'s Children\\'s Museum, also in\\n      South Boston. Nearby will be a 400-room Marriot Renaissance Hotel,\\n      expected to cost $140 million, which will open in 2007. Boston Harbor\\n      Residences, a high-end, two-tower rental and condominium development,\\n      opens in 2005. Breaking ground in 2005 is the massive $230 million Battery\\n      Wharf mixed-use project in the North End, which will be composed of four\\n      buildings and include high-end condos and the luxury Regent Boston hotel. In 2004, the Onyx Hotel, a hip, pet-friendly boutique hotel, opened in\\n      North Station. The Saltonstall office building at 100 Cambridge St. was\\n      completely overhauled, and in 2004 re-opened as a 279,000 square foot\\n      mixed-use tower of condominiums, office and retail space. In the Fenway\\n      neighborhood, Trilogy, a $200-million, 651,000-square-foot mixed use\\n      development, broke ground in 2004 to bring housing, 42,000 square feet of\\n      retail space, and underground parking to Boylston St. and Brookline Ave.\\n      Construction will begin soon on a new emergency and trauma center for the\\n      UMass Memorial Medical Center, in Worchester, which is expected to cost\\n      $129 million. In the Longwood Medical Area, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical\\n      Center will start construction on a 700,000 square foot research center,\\n      the first building of which will open in 2007. Also in Longwood, the\\n      Massachusetts Mental Health Center will get a $200 million make-over in\\n      2005, adding medical offices, research space, and housing, both market\\n      value and low-income apartments. A new Intercontinental Hotel at 500\\n      Atlantic Avenue will feature 424 hotel rooms on the first 12 floors, with\\n      luxury condos on the floors above, in a $255 million development.

In 2004\\n      the port handled 1.3 million tons of general cargo, 1.5 million tons of\\n      non-fuels bulk cargo and 12.8 million tons of bulk fuel. Boston\\'s\\n      popularity as a port is easily understood: it accommodates even the\\n      largest ocean going freighters. One of the best natural harbors in the\\n      United States, the Fort Point Channel is 40 feet deep and 7 miles long.\\n      Nearly 40 miles of docks and wharves line the shores of Boston\\'s\\n      inner harbor, mainly between South Boston and Charlestown. The\\n      Massachusetts Port Authority operates the docks. Facilities include the Conley Container Terminal, the center of container\\n      handling, with 2000 feet of berthing space; Boston Autoport, processing\\n      nearly 100,000 cars a year; Commonwealth Pier, a huge dry dock in South\\n      Boston; and Fish Pier, one of the world\\'s largest and oldest in the\\n      country. Cruiseport and Black Falcon Cruise Terminal is a stopping point\\n      for 15 cruise lines, such as Norwegian and Cunard. Boston\\'s\\n      shipping needs are also accommodated by the network of highways running\\n      through and around the city, a large commercial trucking fleet, railroads,\\n      and delivery services. Labor Force and Employment Outlook As the home of world-renowned colleges and universities, Boston boasts a\\n      highly educated work force. The minority population, including the\\n      Hispanic population, is on the increase. Educational institutions are an\\n      important source of new, highly skilled professionals for the\\n      city\\'s labor force. Wages in the Boston area tend to be high, as are taxes and office lease\\n      rates. Entrepreneurial software and biotechnology companies attracted to\\n      the assets of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have tended to\\n      locate in East Cambridge, just across the Charles River from Boston.\\n      Analysts have given the city high marks in recent years for improvements\\n      in management, and a strong academic and research base should continue to\\n      stand Boston in good stead. The following is a summary of data regarding the Boston metropolitan NECTA\\n      labor force, 2004 annual averages. Size of nonagricultural labor force: 2,398,900 Number of workers employed in . . . natural resources and mining: 1,200 construction: 100,500 manufacturing: 231,200 trade, transportation and utilities: 424,100 information: 72,800 financial activities: 182,800 professional and business services: 374,200 educational and health services: 431,600 leisure and hospitality: 206,900 other services: 85,700 government: 288,000 Average hourly earnings of production workers employed in manufacturing: $18.65 Unemployment rate: 4.9% (March 2005) Largest private employers Number of employees Massachusetts General Hospital Corporation 14,907 Fidelity Investments 11,250 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 8,568 Brigham & Women\\'s Hospital, Inc. 8,421 Boston University 8,297 Children\\'s Hospital 5,116 New England Medical Center 5,077 John Hancock Life Insurance Co. 4,793 Boston Medical Center 4,650 Harvard (business and medical schools) 4,557 Cost of Living When compared with the national average, living in Boston is expensive,\\n      even more so than in other New England cities. The high cost of housing\\n      contributes to the overall expense.

They named the peninsula\\n      \"Shawmut,\" which meant variously \"land accessible by\\n      water\" in reference to the harbor or \"land with living\\n      fountains,\" a comment on the area\\'s abundant fresh water\\n      springs. When two-thirds of the native population succumbed to a European\\n      disease against which they carried no immunity, the way was clear for\\n      transAtlantic settlers. The area\\'s first white settler from across the Atlantic arrived on\\n      the peninsula in the 1620s. William Blackstone, an English clergyman, was\\n      the leader of a small band who eventually returned to England, leaving\\n      Blackstone alone in his home atop what was later Boston\\'s Beacon\\n      Hill. Blackstone and subsequent English settlers eventually became\\n      friendly with the local native tribes, whose democratic form of tribal\\n      governance, some historians claim, influenced the country\\'s\\n      founding fathers in their conception of the Declaration of Independence\\n      and U.S. Constitution. Boston was founded in 1630 by a Protestant religious sect called the\\n      Puritans. They named the new town for their former home in Lincolnshire,\\n      England. The same year, Boston was declared the capital of the\\n      Massachusetts Bay Colony. Bounded on three sides by water, Boston soon\\n      became the colonies\\' major New England seaport and the largest\\n      British settlement on the continent as well. When the Massachusetts Bay\\n      Colony\\'s charter was revoked in 1684, Boston for the first time was\\n      subject to direct British authority. Although unused to trans-Atlantic interference in their affairs,\\n      Bostonians nevertheless enjoyed a flowering of thought and culture never\\n      allowed during the years of strict Puritan dominance. As it developed into\\n      a major colonial center, Boston was the site of the calling of the\\n      nation\\'s first Grand Jury in 1635; the opening of the\\n      nation\\'s oldest school, the Boston Latin School, in 1635; the\\n      building of the first post office in 1639; the chartering of the\\n      colonies\\' first bank in 1674; the publication of the\\n      nation\\'s oldest newspaper, Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick, banned after one issue in 1690; and the publishing of the nation\\'s\\n      first long-running newspaper, the Boston News-Letter, in 1704. By 1750, Boston\\'s population was 15,000 people. Revolution Precedes Maritime Supremacy Continued protest over the British Crown\\'s introduction of a series\\n      of unpopular taxes (including those on stamps and tea) brought British\\n      soldiers to Boston in 1768. The colonists\\' rallying cry soon became\\n      \"No taxation without representation!\" Two years later, in\\n      1770, British soldiers opened fire on a hostile crowd gathered in front of\\n      the Old State House. Five people were killed, including Crispus Attucks, a\\n      mulatto and the first African American to fall in America\\'s fight\\n      for freedom from colonial status. The confrontation, dubbed the\\n      \"Boston Massacre,\" further inflamed Bostonians and patriots\\n      throughout the thirteen colonies. In 1773, Samuel Adams and a group of\\n      followers dressed as Indians carried out the \"Boston Tea\\n      Party\" by emptying the holds of three British ships and dumping\\n      their shipment of taxable tea into Boston Harbor. The British Parliament\\n      responded by closing the port, effectively stifling the city\\'s\\n      economy. Troops of Minutemen began to drill throughout the colonies. Then, in 1775,\\n      ill feeling intensified when colonists learned that the British troops\\n      planned to seize weapons stockpiled in Concord, eighteen miles west of\\n      Boston. On the night of April 18, two lanterns were hung in the belfry of\\n      Boston\\'s Old North Church, signaling that the British were\\n      approaching by land. Silversmith Paul Revere received the message and rode\\n      through the night to warn his colleagues at Concord. Revere was arrested\\n      along the way, but a second rider, Charles Dawes, delivered the warning.\\n      On April 19, British troops found the Minutemen armed and prepared for the\\n      confrontation that would become known as the \"shot heard\\n      \\'round the world.\" It was the first battle of the American\\n      Revolutionary War. Following the Revolution, Boston once again resumed its maritime activity.\\n      Outgoing cargoes included ocean fish and rum from New England and tobacco\\n      from the South. Incoming goods included molasses from the West Indies,\\n      used to distill rum. With the successful resolution of the War of 1812,\\n      Boston began a lucrative trade with China. U.S. ships sailed around Cape\\n      Horn and into the Orient and India, returning to the United States with\\n      tea, silks, and spices. The design of a new and faster vessel, the clipper\\n      ship, further enhanced Boston\\'s maritime supremacy. The invention\\n      of the water-powered loom made Boston an important textile center, and its\\n      wool industry grew to rival England\\'s. Boston received its city charter in 1822 and chose a mayor-council form of\\n      government. The original hilly Shawmut Peninsula upon which the city was\\n      built covered 800 acres surrounded by salt marshes, mudflats, and inlets\\n      of water. As Boston outgrew her site in the 1800s, most of the hills were\\n      leveled and used as fill to create Boston\\'s famous Back Bay\\n      district. Boston\\'s tax base grew when the city annexed neighboring\\n      towns such as Noddle\\'s Island, which was renamed East Boston. In\\n      1821, Boston opened Boston English High School, the nation\\'s oldest\\n      high school. Manufacturing, Finance, Education Take Lead Boston\\'s population remained largely of English descent until the\\n      mid-1800s, when the first waves of European immigrants began to arrive.\\n      The Cabots and Lodges were typical of the leading Puritan families who\\n      became known as the Boston Brahmins. The city experienced an upsurge in\\n      manufacturing around the mid-1800s, aided by the invention of the\\n      railroad. Among the new industries were the making of shoes and other\\n      leather goods, until recently a mainstay of the Boston economy. Irish\\n      peasants seeking refuge from the potato famines in Ireland found work in\\n      Boston\\'s factories and on the wharves. They settled in East Boston\\n      and Charlestown, which remain blue-collar Irish enclaves. From the end of Puritan domination, Boston had been a religiously tolerant\\n      city. In the mid-1800s, Boston became the site of two major movements in\\n      the United States. The Unitarian Church was founded when a portion of\\n      dissatisfied Congregationalists broke away and formed a new sect. The\\n      Unitarian Church, in turn, became a progenitor of the Transcendental\\n      movement of the late nineteenth century. Boston was also the focus of the\\n      New England Anti-Slavery Society, founded in 1832. The Society\\'s\\n      publication, The Liberator, helped identify North-South differences that eventually erupted into the\\n      Civil War. Boston\\'s African American population in the mid-1800s\\n      was sizable, in part because Massachusetts had declared slavery illegal in\\n      1783. By the time of the Civil War, Boston was the center of the\\n      Abolitionist Movement and a stop on the Underground Railroad, which aided\\n      escaping slaves. During the Civil War, Boston supplied 26,000 soldiers and sailors to the\\n      Union and acted as an important military seaport. When the war ended,\\n      Boston\\'s maritime importance diminished, though the city gained\\n      prominence in the world of finance. Meanwhile, intellectuals who gathered\\n      in Boston helped reunite the divided nation. Poets like James Russell\\n      Lowell, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Greenleaf Whittier, along\\n      with novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, jurist Oliver Wendall Holmes,\\n      philosophers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, and historians\\n      William H. Prescott and Francis Parkman wrote about the American spirit\\n      and helped define the American character. It was Holmes who, noting this\\n      concentration of influential thinkers, dubbed Boston the \"hub of\\n      the solar system.\" Set-Backs Countered by Redevelopment By 1900, Boston\\'s population had reached 561,000, partially swelled\\n      by the new wave of Italian immigrants who settled on Boston\\'s North\\n      End. Along with the French-Canadians who arrived next, they combined with\\n      the resident\\n       Irish to make Boston the nation\\'s second largest Roman Catholic\\n      archdiocese. An established population, Boston\\'s Irish began to\\n      figure in municipal politics. John F. \"Honey\" Fitzgerald was\\n      the town\\'s first Irish mayor. He was elected to two terms, in 1906\\n      and again in 1910. He established a political dynasty that included U.S.\\n      President John Fitzgerald Kennedy among his descendants. Fishing, food\\n      processing, shoe making, and wool products were viable Boston industries\\n      at the turn of the century, by which time the demand for ship building had\\n      diminished. Like many of the nation\\'s industrialized cities, Boston\\n      suffered economically between the world wars. First Prohibition, which\\n      made the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages illegal, destroyed\\n      the rum trade, then the Great Depression of the 1930s undermined\\n      Boston\\'s financial market and, finally, New England\\'s\\n      textile industry moved South in search of less expensive labor. At this\\n      time, Boston began to acquire a dual reputation for corrupt machine\\n      politics and racial segregation. The city did a great deal to end\\n      corruption when council seats were declared open in 1951. Racial tension,\\n      however, continues to be a problem in Boston. Tempers flared over\\n      court-ordered pupil busing intended to desegregate the city\\'s\\n      schools, and some Boston neighborhoods have yet to be integrated. Following World War II, Boston\\'s population grew to a peak of\\n      801,000 in 1950, then began to level off and eventually declined. Its\\n      industries were mature and its infrastructure aging. The diminishing tax\\n      base led to an increase in taxes levied and a subsequent loss of the white\\n      middle class population to the suburbs. This trend, however, was countered\\n      in 1957 with the establishment of the Boston Redevelopment Authority,\\n      formed to revitalize the city. Through the efforts of this group, the\\n      Prudential Tower, a major office complex, was built in downtown Boston,\\n      along with a public auditorium, apartments, and office-retail structures.\\n      A new government center was constructed adjacent to historic Faneuil Hall,\\n      and other projects included shopping areas, neighborhood renewal, and\\n      development of water-front and historic districts. Boston also benefitted\\n      from the electronics research industry that emerged in the region in the\\n      1950s. Boston grew rapidly on the strength of its high-tech and defense-related\\n      research industries until the late 1980s. A combination of factors\\n      including high taxes, wages, office lease rates, and housing costs began\\n      to drive businesses to surrounding communities and states. Boston has,\\n      however, received high marks from analysts for its responsible handling of\\n      these and other fiscal problems. A strong economic turnaround which began\\n      around 1993 is continuing into the new century. As host to the Democratic\\n      National Convention in 2004, Boston promotes tourism (always a staple of\\n      its economy) to boost its national image. At the beginning of the new century, Boston\\'s Mayor Tom Menino said\\n      of his city: \"The major challenge facing Boston in the twenty-first\\n      century is that of new prosperity; how to renew Boston in a way that\\n      honors the beautiful historic city left in our care. We are fortunate to\\n      be living in one of those rare times in our City\\'s life, a time\\n      when we have a chance to reinvent Boston and preserve the best of it for\\n      many years to come.\" Today\\'s Boston remains a mecca for\\n      education and culture, and is a forward-looking city steeped in tradition\\n      and history.

Heavy traffic, narrow one-way\\n      streets, limited parking, traffic rotaries, and jay-walking pedestrians\\n      combine to make driving difficult in Boston, especially in the downtown\\n      area. Most residents leave their cars at home and ride Boston\\'s\\n      superb public transportation, known as the \"T.\" This rapid\\n      transit system includes elevated lines, subways, and surface routes.\\n      Trolleys, street cars, and buses supplement the \"T.\" Private\\n      transportation includes Amtrak commuter trains, taxis, and ferry boats. The \"T\" is operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation\\n      Authority (MBTA). Boston\\'s system is the oldest in the country, and\\n      all five lines converge downtown. Boston is one of only five U.S. cities\\n      to use trolleys and street cars as a regular part of its transportation\\n      system. Amtrak runs two commuter trains from surrounding suburbs into\\n      Boston, one of which is operated by the MBTA and is known locally as the\\n      \"Purple Line.\" Two ferry systems convey passengers on the\\n      rivers and channels around Boston.

The first professional sports team to call the arena home was the Boston Bruins ice hockey team. For seventy years it would not only host thousands of regular season and championship games but also numerous civic and artistic events. Among the speakers that addressed a packed arena over the years were world leaders like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy. World class performing artists that played the Boston Garden included James Brown, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin and scores of others. The \"Greatest Shows on Earth\\'\\' when in Boston, like the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus would be found at this indoor stadium. The most talked about legend of the Garden however, was the parquet floor on which the NBA team, the Boston Celtics, play. Said floor was installed in 1946 at the Boston Arena, with wood extracted from the forests of Tennessee by the Boston Lumber Company. The floor is said to have cost $11,000. At that time, the Celtics played their home games interchangeably at both the Boston Arena (which would later become the Matthews Arena) and the Boston Garden. In 1952 that floor was moved to the Boston Garden, which from that moment on became the exclusive home court of the Celtics until 1995, when the building was closed forever. The Celtics\\' parquet floor was the only part of the old structure however, that was moved to the new venue, initially named the Fleet Center. The Fleet Center opened on September 30, 1995, with a construction cost of 160 million dollars. It was built on 3.2-acres just nine inches away from the site of the original facility with a 19,580 capacity. In 1997 the old building was demolished. Over the years a myth had evolved around the Celtics frequent ability to compete for the championship based in the parquet floor. It was a said that the team could predict which way the ball would bounce off of any given section. But in late 1999 the last game was played on the old floor, (much of which, in reality, had been replaced over the years, one section at a time, due to damages from use.). On January 3, of 2000, a new floor was inaugurated beneath the treads of the team, although some sections of the old parquet floor have been recycled into this new floor, keeping this urban myth alive. The Parquet floor aside, the home team did have a distinct advantage in the original Boston Garden. The fans sat much closer to the players than in most stadiums as part of the design by boxing promoter Tex Rickard, who wanted the fans to see the sweat dripping off of two opponents in the ring. While this may have raised team morale for home players it almost surely hurt morale for visiting teams when the Boston fans got angry and were that much closer to the area of play. Despite that advantage, the old stadium had many problems like continuous electrical failures, no air conditioning and a non-regulation size hockey ring. The new facility was built to overcome the flaws in order to make fans even more comfortable at sporting events and other activities in a modern setting. Due to popular demand, by 2005 it was agreed to change the new buildings name to TD Banknorth Garden, which was immediately restored to Boston Garden by Bostonians. Today the Boston Garden continues to be home to the National Hockey League team of the Boston Bruins, the National Basket Ball Association team of the Boston Celtics and the National Lacrosse League team of the Boston Blazers. In addition to hosting major sports, music and entertainment events the multi-purpose arena already hosted a major political event, the 2004 Democratic National Convention. The facility received major upgrades only 10 years after it was built. In 2006, 20 million dollars were spent on, among other things, the construction of a 20,000 foot expansion of the North Station train concourse below the stadium and the installation of the first high definition scoreboard. With the local recognition and prestige of this name since 1928, any world class event in the City of Boston will continue to be held at the Boston Garden for the coming decades. 1 Cat Dec 10, 2010 @ 8:20 pm I just bet my friend $100.00 that the ice in the old garden was melted and drained prior to installation the parquet floor so the Celtics could play B-ball.

The nearly 50-acre Boston Common was established in 1634, initially for common pasture land. It was also the site of public hangings and was used for military purposes. During the war for independence it was the site of the British troop encampment prior to their departure in April of 1775 to the renowned battle of Lexington and Concord. Monuments to the War for Independence and dozens of other landmarks fill the downtown area and the park itself. The Visitor\\'s Center in Boston Common is the departure point to see those sites along the Freedom Trail, which many a visitor and most Bostonians have embarked upon at least once. In past decades this park has served as the site of a diversity of major public speakers including Gloria Steinem, Martin Luther King Jr., and Pope John Paul II. It has also been the site for Boston activists to organize public demonstrations and protests throughout the last 100 years. Since March of 2008, debate has begun around limiting the number of large events allowed to occur in the park in order to limit the impact on the ecosystem and the parks natural beauty. It is the hills of the Boston Common where city children sled in the winter and skate on the frozen \"frog pond.\\'\\' In hot months that same skating rink becomes a wading pool, with sprinkler jets that cool the kids, giving parents some quiet time in the midst of a family picnic. Like any major city park, the summer is a scene of concerts, rollerblading and biking as well as the best people watching that Boston can offer. Of course the gallows were removed and the grazing came to a halt in the first half of the 19th century, prior to the public park system being created as such. Indeed it was in 1850 when the idea for a public park system first emerged. At that time the Boston Common was the only such public space. Finally in 1867 a law for Boston parks was approved by the Massachusetts State Legislature. Several years went by before, between 1878 and 1896, the Emerald necklace was created, based on the plan of the leading landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. The necklace, which is anchored by Boston Common and the neighboring Public Garden is a seven-mile semi-circle of interconnected green spaces throughout Boston. While many rural areas are only a short trip outside of the city, the Boston Common and surrounding parks take the edge off city-life and by providing an oasis in the heart of this urban center.

Welcoming more than 1.3 million visitors annually, the New England Aquarium focuses much of its efforts on oceanic conservation and environmental awareness. It is home to over 20,000 animals divided among 600 species. Being one of the bigger tourist draws in the area, the New England Aquarium hosts a number of educational and entertaining programs to teach visitors about aquatic animal life and environmental issues. The aquarium itself maintains an active involvement in conservation, hosting a number of programs that help the environment recover from issues such as global warming and pollution. The New England Aquarium supports programs that protect the rare and endangered North Atlantic right whale, prevents the destruction of the Amazonian rainforests, and studies the effects of global warming on the Earth\\'s oceans and sea life. The New England Aquarium boasts a 200,000 gallon tank that emulates a Caribbean coral reef, serving as a home to countless fish and other sea life, such as sharks and sea turtles. The Giant Ocean Tank is cylindrical in shape, and is surrounded by 52 windows that allow visitors to see its inhabitants from an array of angles. Also present is a 150,000 gallon penguin exhibit, where several species of penguins swim and play to the amusement of patrons to the aquarium. There are also smaller tanks, such as \"Thinking\\'\\' Gallery, a Freshwater tank, and the \"Edge of the Sea\\'\\' tide pool, which lets visitors touch and interact with various sea life, ranging from sea urchins to horseshoe crabs. The Northern Waters of the World Gallery explores Northeastern oceanic habitats and compares them with Pacific Northwestern habitats. A Tropical Gallery is also available, featuring a plethora of colorful fish and ocean life. Free for all visitors is the Harbor Seal exhibit. Sea mammal training sessions are also available to the public eye, and aquarium attendees can view animal feedings and tank dives throughout the week. The New England Aquarium is also home to its own IMAX Theater, offering patrons a cinematic learning experience like no other. The Simons IMAX Theater has been host to a number of special screenings of aquarium-exclusive educational programs. In 2007, the aquarium launched a new program, named \"Killer Instincts\\'\\', designed to educate patrons about the sea animals people tend to fear, such as electric eels, sharks, barracudas, and giant octopuses. The annual David B. Stone award is issued by the aquarium to individuals, groups, or organizations that show their commitment to aiding in oceanic conservation and protection. Created in 1970, this award honors aquarium founder David B. Stone. Another event held by the aquarium is the Blue Planet Ball.

The Public Garden was established in 1837 when philanthropist Horace Gray asked for the use of land as the first public botanical garden in the United States. Gray helped to marshal political resistance to a number of Boston City Council is trying to sell the land in question, finally resolve the question of devoting the public garden in 1856. The Act establishing the land use was submitted to the voters on April 26, 1856 where it passed with only 99 dissents. Today the north side of the lake is a small island, but originally was a peninsula, connected to land. The site became so popular with fans of the John Galvin, the city forester, decided to cut the connection to the earth. The landscape of twenty-four hectares, which was once a marsh, was designed by George F. Meacham. The paths and flower beds were placed by the city engineer, James Slade and Forestry, John Galvin. The plan for the garden includes a series of fountains and statues. The first statue was erected by Edward Everett William Wetmore Story, in November 1867 in the northern part of the garden, near Beacon Street. The bronze statue of George Washington by Thomas Ball, which dominates the west side of the park, was dedicated on 3 July 1869. The firm suspension bridge in the middle of the lake was built in 1867. The public garden is run jointly between the Office of the Mayor, the Parks Department of the City of Boston, and friends of the non-profit public gardens. It was declared a National Historic Monument in 1987. Along with the Boston Common, these two parks form the northern terminus of the Emerald Necklace, a string of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. While the common open space is largely unstructured, the Public Garden contains a lake and a series of formal plantings that are maintained by the city and others, and vary from season to season. During the warmer seasons, the four acre pond is usually the home of one or more of the swans and is always the site of the Swan Boats, a famous tourist attraction in Boston. For a small fee, tourists can sit on a boat decorated with a white swan in the back. The boat is then pedaled around the lake by a tour guide sitting on the swan. The Public Garden is rectangular and is bounded on the south by Boylston Street, west of Arlington Street, and north of Beacon Street, where it faces Beacon Hill. On its east side, Charles Street divides the common public garden. The greenway that connects the public garden, with the rest of the Emerald Necklace is a strip of park that runs west through the center of Commonwealth Avenue to the marshes of Back Bay and the river of mud.

Chinatown is one of the most densely populated residential districts in the Boston area, with a reported 28,000 people per square mile in the year 2000. Nearly 70% of the population is Asia's Chinatown, with an average household income of $14,289. The only historic Chinese site in New England is Chinatown and the area is located in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. Focused on Beach Street, the neighborhood borders along Boston Common and Downtown Crossing. To the far south is Highway Southeast or Massachusetts Turnpike. Part of it occupies a floor space reclaimed by filling the tides or tidal flat and the newly built area was first settled by the Anglo-Bostonians. After residential properties in this area became less desirable due to the development of railways, which was settled by a mixed sequence of Ireland, the Jewish immigrants, Italian, Syrian, and Chinese. Each group replaces the former to take advantage of low cost housing and employment opportunities in the area. During the late nineteenth century, the manufacturing plants of clothing also moved to Chinatown, the garment creation of the historic district of Boston. The garment district was active until the 1990s. Negotiations culminated in the provision of funds for the construction of new housing in the Chinatown community. During this period, city officials also designated an area adjacent to Chinatown and Boston's red light district, also known as the combat zone. The traditional Chinatown Gate (paifang) with foo lion on each side is at the intersection of Beach Street and the road surface. The Gate is visible from the southern bus terminal and is a popular tourist destination and great photo opportunity. Chinatown offers excellent local and regional transport. It is served by the MBTA Red Line, Silver Line and Commuter Rail station in the south and the Orange Line station in Chinatown. Interstate 93 and the Massachusetts Turnpike are close behind. Two Chinese-owned bus services (Fung Wah and Lucky Star / Travel pack) provide hourly connections with New York's Chinatown. Tufts Medical Center overlooks part of the area and includes a full-service hospital and health facility associated with various schools including Tufts University, Tufts University School of Medicine, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine. In addition, South Cove Community Health Center Chinatown Clinic operates at 885 Washington Avenue. South Cove volunteers founded it in 1972, to provide better health care for Asian Americans in the Chinatown area. In recent years, a new satellite Chinatown has been rapidly emerging approximately 10 miles south on Hancock Street in the nearby city of Quincy. This is due to the rapid influx of Hokkien-speaking mainland Chinese immigrants from Fujian Province and a large and growing population of Vietnamese origin. There are already several large Asian supermarkets, such as food and Man Kam Super 88 supermarket chains and other businesses that compete with Boston's Chinatown. Several companies operating in Chinatown now have branches in Quincy.

Local residents and long-term Boston residents include many neighborhoods within the downtown region as well as much of the financial district. In Boston, this seems to be par for the course. Like most areas within Boston, the district has no official definitive borders and boundaries. It is roughly bounded by Atlantic Avenue, State Street and Devonshire Street. Parts of the district are in different postal USPS ZIP Codes including 02108, 02109, 02110, and 02111. T subway station at Atlantic Avenue and State Street is officially designated the Aquarium, Financial, or Downtown District. The area includes Post Office Square, the international exchange complex, Plaza Place, and the historic Custom House Tower which is now a private condominium. The district also contains the headquarters of the mutual fund companies Fidelity Investments, Putnam Investments and DWS Scudder Investments, the global headquarters of State Street Bank, Boston Stock Exchange, the accounting firm RSM McGladrey, Judge swap loan debt, the law firms of Goodwin Procter, WilmerHale, Kirkpatrick & Lockhart Nicholson Graham, and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, PC; the local headquarters of Bank of America (formerly Fleet Bank) and Sovereign Bank, Langham Boston Hotel and the Hilton Hotel, and local offices of Merrill Lynch and other firms. Dewey Square at One Financial Center, and the Square Towers housing the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is located near South Station, adjacent and south of the area defined above. Also, part of the financial district is 33 Arch Street with a Federal, the First National Bank of Building Construction, and also 101 Federal Street. The area contains many of the skyscrapers of Boston in a rather dense, much more than the Back Bay, which contains two tallest skyscrapers in Boston, Prudential Center and John Hancock Tower. Many of the skyscrapers of the financial district range up in the heights of 500 feet and most rise above 40 stories high. There are also numerous proposals for the area and many skyscrapers are under construction in the area. Russia Wharf is currently the highest building, reaching 32 floors and 395 meters when completed. South Station Tower has been approved for the area above the South Station and will rise to 41 floors and 621 meters. Other proposals that would modify and expand the horizon of national transport include Boston Place, which would amount to 1,175 feet to become one of the nation's tallest skyscrapers. There were also some other proposals such as the Congress Street towers, and towers of aquarium Garage Woud both be over 50 floors and at least 500 feet. State Street Corporation is headquartered at One Lincoln Street building. Fish & Richardson is based in the State Street Bank building in the Financial District. In 2009, Fish & Richardson agreed to lease space in a Marine Park in South Boston as its new headquarters and leave its current headquarters. It will move from the third quarter in 2010.

The community was created by connecting several islands, using landfill and then was annexed by Boston in 1836. East Boston is separated from the rest of the city by Boston Harbor and bordered by Winthrop, Revere, Chelsea and the creek. Directly west of East Boston across Boston Harbor is the North End and Boston\\'s financial district. The neighborhood has long provided a foothold for the latest wave of immigrants, Irish, Russian Jews and Italians and then alternating the predominant group. Today, immigrants from El Salvador, Brazil and elsewhere in Central and South America East Boston have made a center of Latino culture in New England. In East Boston, which some call \"EASTI\" the demographic has changed to predominantly Hispanic, and the once important Italian population still lives in areas such as Orient Heights. While East Boston has a spectacular view of the city skyline, the rental prices of the community and property values have risen more slowly than the extraordinary increase witnessed in the rest of the metropolitan area of Boston during the 1990s and early 2000. This slower growth can be attributed to factors such as the isolated nature of the neighborhood, difficulties of real estate development along the coast and the negative attitude towards the local Logan Airport East Boston residents. Sites in the neighborhood that are popular with tourists and locals are: Sanctuary of the Madonna and Don Orione - One of the most recognizable icons of East Boston is the 35-foot-high statue of the Virgin. The Madonna Shrine, atop Orient Heights, is the national headquarters of the Don Orione order. Built in 1954, the statue is a scale replica of the one at the Don Orione Center in the district of Monte Mario in Rome, Italy. It was built in 1954 by Jewish and Italian sculptor Arrigo Minerbi, who wanted to show his gratitude to the Catholic Church for having shielded him and his family from the Nazis during World War II. Across the street from the Shrine is the Don Orione Home, a nursing home, as the Sanctuary, was founded by the Don Orione priests. Suffolk Downs - Powered by Route 1 and a blue line stop, Suffolk Downs was opened in 1935 and the point considered modern, although it now seems dated. For years they have held a Grade II event at the track called the MassCap. More recently, the issue has complained that revenues have been drained as a result of Indian casinos in Rhode Island and Connecticut and have canceled the MassCap. On 18 August 1966, the Beatles played a concert before some 24,000 music fans in the box Suffolk Downs. Piers Park - Piers Park is on the west side of East Boston and overlooks Boston Harbor with downtown Boston in the background. The park consists of meandering brick promenades with open grass and tree sections. There are several pavilions, one of which is dedicated to Donald McKay. Along with the amphitheater, there is a community sailing program, Piers Park Sailing Center.

Located at 4 Yawkey Way, the park has served as the home stadium of the club\\'s baseball team, Boston Red Sox, since it opened in 1912 and is the oldest stadium in Major League Baseball currently in use. It is the only ballpark of the original standards that are still in use today. Due to the limited age and location of the park in an urban neighborhood next to the large campus of the University of Boston, the park has had many renovations and additions in recent years not originally planned for. This resulted in unique and peculiar architecture and landscape which was known as \"the Triangle \",\" Pesky Pole\" and especially the famous Green Monster in left field. Fenway Park is known for hosting dedicated Red Sox fans, so-called \"Red Sox Nation. Every Red Sox home game since May 15, 2003, has been sold, in 2008; the park sold its 456th consecutive game the Red Sox, breaking a record in the majors. Fenway Park has also been the site of other sporting and cultural events, including professional football games for the Boston Redskins and the Boston Patriots, concerts and political campaigns. On 15 May 1999 then CEO of the Red Sox, John Harrington, announced plans for a new Fenway Park to be built near the existing structure. It should have the same dimensions in the field, are a green monster, basically a replica of the existing fleet, but was upgraded to replace some of the features of old Fenway Park. Some sections of the old Fenway Park would be preserved (mainly the original Green Monster and the third base side of the park) as part of the new overall design. Most of the old park would be demolished to make room for new development, with a section that is at the home of a baseball museum and a public park. This was a very controversial idea, as most fans consider Boston area sports Fenway Park to be sacred ground, and demolition of the old park that have caused significant distress. Various groups emerged, such as \"Save Fenway Park\" to try to block the move. All parties discussed for several years about the details of the new stadium. One plan even involved the construction of a \"Sports Megaplex\" in South Boston, where a new Fenway Park would be located next to a new stadium for the New England Patriots. The Patriots ultimately built a new stadium in Foxboro, and that the plan was abandoned. Even after several more rounds of discussions, the Red Sox could not reach an agreement with the city of Boston for a new stadium. In 2005, the group owning the Red Sox announced that the team would remain at the current Fenway Park indefinitely. Before the 2008 season, Fenway Park\\'s capacity was increased to 39,928, where it remains for additional renovations following the 2009 season, Fenway representation as the smallest room, behind the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Tropicana Field and PNC Park. Renewal before the 2009 season now allow the Sox to sell tickets for about 350 more each game, although the official capacity has not increased.

While a neighborhood may be considered for administrative purposes, this one actually consists of numerous neighborhoods with two very different feels, and is rarely regarded as a single entity. Locals call the neighborhood \"The Fenway,\" and \"Kenmore Square\" or simply \"Kenmore.\\'\\' In addition, the Fenway neighborhood is divided into two distinct sub districts commonly referred to as the East Fenway/Symphony and Fenway Park West. Fenway is the name of The Fenway, a principal avenue established by Frederick Law Olmsted. The neighborhood is home to Fenway Park, the famous Citgo sign, Kenmore Square, the Art Institute of Boston, the Forsyth Institute, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Northeastern University in the New England Conservatory, the portions of the University Boston (including Myles Standish Residence), part of Harvard Medical School, Berklee College of Music, Boston Conservatory, Massachusetts College of Art, Wentworth Institute of Technology, Simmons College, Wheelock College, Emmanuel College, the New England School of Photography, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Fenway Park is a neighborhood on the south by Mission Hill, Back Bay Fens and Columbus Avenue in the north by the Mass Pike, and west by Mission Hill. The district consists almost entirely of five to six story apartment buildings with small independently owned shops scattered throughout. Race, Fenway is predominantly white but also has a large population of Asian Americans and African. East Fenway remains largely populated while Fenway West was formerly known as a haven for students because of its proximity to many city colleges and universities, but due to growing interest in the area and the high rents, has become full of young professionals and families of many of whom work in the neighboring Longwood Medical and Academic Area. The crime rate in the neighborhood remains relatively low. Kenmore is located north and west of Fenway Park, and shares many of the same attributes of Fenway. Fenway Park is actually located in Kenmore, across the Mass Pike from Kenmore Square. Many students from nearby Boston University and Northeastern University reside in the neighborhood. The area is almost entirely brick, walk-up buildings and brownstone houses, although in the last 20 years almost every residential building in Kenmore has been purchased by Boston University and became the dormitories, especially in the area Audubon Circle between Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue. Fenway Park is separated from the Back Bay by the Muddy River, which flows through the Back Bay Fens and the Charles River. The neighborhood is served by the MBTA Green Line, with stops at Hynes, Kenmore, Fenway, Symphony, Northeastern and the Museum of Fine Arts. Fenway Kenmore is served by a number of MBTA buses. The Fenway Park Drive circulates around the marshes. Boylston Street is a major east-west and Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue, crossing in Kenmore Square. Huntington Avenue (Route 9) is located on the southern border.

The neighborhood is roughly bounded by Columbus Avenue and the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury to the east, Longwood Avenue to the northeast and the Olmsted designed Riverway/ Jamaicaway and the town of Brookline to the west. Northernly is adjacent to the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston. It is served by the MBTA Green Line E Branch and the Orange Line and is within walking distance of the Museum of Fine Arts. \"Coincidences\" Hill with about half of the Longwood Medical and Academic Area, home of 21 health services research and education institutions are responsible for the largest employment area in the city of Boston out of town. Due to these adjacencies, the neighborhood is often struggling with institutional growth has residential buildings and occupying storefront commercial space. But recent years have seen new retail stores, restaurants and residential development in the neighborhood giving a stronger political voice and identity. Mission Hill is historic district architecture with a combination of detached houses built at the beginning of wealthy landowners, blocks of traditional brick row houses and two flats Triple many. Many are condominiums, but there are several families of two and some houses. The district was named in March 2008 as one of the \"25 Best Zip Codes in Massachusetts\" by the Boston Globe, citing a higher value on houses, restaurants and abundant shopping, a marked racial diversity and that 65% of the residents walk, bike or take transportation to work. The district has two main shopping streets: Tremont Street (north and south) and Huntington Ave. (which runs east and west). Both have several small restaurants and shops. Mission Hill is located at the western end of Tremont Street, with Beacon Hill in the east. Mission Hill has two main ZIP Codes; the southern half is designated and the northern 02120 is 02115. In addition, a very small portion of southeastern edge uses the code and 02130 two streets on the western edge use 02215. Parker Hill, Roxbury Crossing, the Triangle District, behind Hill and Calumet Square are areas within the Mission Hill, a designated official in the Boston neighborhood (as evidenced by numerous signs prohibiting parking without a tag only can be received by the residents). Brigham Circle, located at the corner of Tremont and Huntington is the neighborhood shopping center with a grocery store (Stop & Shop), pharmacies, bars, banks and taverns. Furthermore, two other smaller commercial areas are in the neighborhood: Roxbury Crossing and the corner of Huntington and South Huntington near the Brookline line. On Tremont Street is Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica (1878, Schickel and Ditmars, 1910 towers, as well as Franz Joseph Bottom), in a landmark building of the same name which dominates the skyline of the area. The church was chosen as the location for the funeral of Senator Edward M. Kennedy on Saturday, August 29th, 2009. At the top of the hill is the New England Baptist Hospital and Parker Hill Playground, which extends from the hospital grounds by Parker Hill Avenue.

It contains more than 450,000 works of art, becoming one of the most comprehensive collections in the Americas. The museum was founded in 1870 and its current location in 1909. In addition to its storage business, the museum is affiliated with an art academy, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, and a sister museum, and the Nagoya Boston Museum of Fine Arts in Nagoya, Japan. The Museum was founded in 1870 and opened in 1876, with much of its collection taken from the Ateneo Art Gallery in Boston. Francis Davis Millet was instrumental in starting the Art School attached to the museum and get Emil Otto Grundmann (1844 - 1890) named its first director. Originally it was located in an ornate brick Gothic Revival building, designed by John Hubbard Sturgis and Charles Brigham and located in Copley Square in the Back Bay of Boston. The Copley Square building was notable for its large scale use of architectural terra cotta in the United States. The museum moved into its current building on Huntington Avenue, Boston, Avenue of the Arts in 1909. Current museum building was started in 1907, when trustees of the museum hired architect Guy Lowell to create a master plan for a museum could be built in stages as funding was obtained for each phase. The first section of Lowell's neoclassical design was completed in 1909, and featured a 500-ft (150 m), granite facade, cut along Huntington Avenue, the grand rotunda, and the associated exhibition galleries. Ms. Robert Dawson Evans then funded the total cost of building the next section of the museum's master plan. This wing along the marshes of Back Bay, opened in 1915 and houses art galleries. From 1916 until 1925, John Singer Sargent created the art that lines the rotunda and the colonnade partners. Numerous building additions extended throughout the year including the wing of Decorative Arts in 1968 and the Norman Jean Calderwood Court Garden and Terrace in 1997. This wing houses the museum cafy, restaurant and gift shop and exhibition space. In the mid 2000s, the museum embarked on a major renovation project. This includes building a new wing for the arts of the Americas, redesigned and expanded educational facilities, and extensive renovation of its galleries of Europe, visitor services and maintenance services. This expansion increases the size of the MFA by 28% with an additional 133,500 square feet (12,400 m2) of space. The new wing was designed in a restricted way, London's contemporary architecture firm Foster and Partners, headed by Lord (Norman) Foster. Groundbreaking for the addition took place in 2006. In the process, the current garden patio will become a climate-controlled for years round glass enclosure. Landscape architects Gustafson Guthrie Nichol redesigned Huntington Avenue and Fenway entrances, gardens, access roads and courtyards. The opening of the new wing is planned for late 2010.

It was one of the first towns founded in the Colony of Massachusetts Bay in 1630, and became a city in 1846 until annexed to Boston on 5 January 1868. The original town of Roxbury once included current Boston neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain, Roslindale, West Roxbury, South End, and much of Back Bay. Roxbury now generally ends at Columbus Avenue to the north and Lenox Street to the east. Roxbury is now one of the 21 officers in the neighborhoods of Boston, used by the city for the coordination of neighborhood services. The city claims that \"serves as the heart of Black culture in Boston.\" Of the original boundaries of the town of Roxbury can be found in Drake\\'s history of Roxbury and took note of his characters. These limits are the Christian Science Center, the Prudential Center (built on the former rail yard in Roxbury) and the entire south and east of the Muddy River including Symphony Hall, Northeastern University, YMCA, Harvard Medical School and many hospitals and Schools in the area. This side of the Muddy River is Roxbury; the other side is Brookline and Boston. Franklin Park, once fully in Roxbury, where Jamaica Plain, West Roxbury and Roslindale were villages within the town of Roxbury until 1854, has divided the line between Roxbury and Jamaica Plain located in the vicinity of Peter Parley Road at Walnut Avenue, through the Columbia street park. Here, Walnut Avenue changes its name to Sigourney Street, indicating the area is now Jamaica Plain. One side of Columbia Street Roxbury the other is Dorchester. Melnea Cass Boulevard is located approximately in the channel that ships Roxbury in Roxbury since bypassing the busy port of Boston in the 1830s. A store known as the Blue Tent, at the intersection of Washington and Warren Street in Dudley since 1699. Many remember the furniture store known as Ferdinand\\'s Blue Store, as the elevated train in two parts of the building. This area was also home to several famous Boston business firms, Hardware W. Bowman Cutter store with its head down sign, Timothy Smith\\'s Department Store, and JS Waterman and Sons, funeral directors for many prominent families in Boston. Roxbury neighborhood remains a mostly African-Americans as it has been since 1960, but there is a growing population of Puerto Rico. In 1987, Nelson Merced, a Puerto Rican, was chosen for the fifth district of Suffolk in Boston. From the 2000 census Roxbury was 5% non-Hispanic whites, 63% non-Hispanic black or Black, 24% Hispanic or Latino may be of any race, 1% from Asia and Latin, 3% from other races and 4% from two or more races. Students at Roxbury are served by the Boston Public Schools (BPS). BPS assigns students based on applicants\\' preferences and priorities of students in different areas. Roxbury is home to Roxbury Community College. The Eastern Nazarene College offers courses for adults / classes lead in Roxbury. Roxbury Preparatory Charter School is a charter school that serves at 6.8 degrees on Mission Hill in Roxbury, MA. Roxbury High School was once located on Greenville Avenue.

To the west of the Shawmut Peninsula, across the bay from Boston, a wide bay opened between Boston and Cambridge, with the Charles River to enter at the west. As with the entire New England coast, the bay was tidal, with water rising and falling several feet throughout the day. Culturally speaking, the Back Bay is known for being the home of the rich and upper middle class. It is best known for its expensive housing and shopping areas. Most stores are located in Newbury and Boylston Street, with the ends closer to the Boston Public Garden traditionally more expensive. Back Bay is full of luxury hotels including the Copley Plaza hotel, the Colonnade Hotel, The Westin Copley Place, Fairmont Copley Plaza, and the largest hotel in the city, the Boston Marriott Copley Place. The Mandarin Oriental, Boston, opened its doors in October 2008 with a house in the arcade area, and a number of luxury designer boutiques and restaurants. The Copley Square area is near the railway terminal of Back Bay, and is the link between the east of a system of hotels and shopping malls connected by a set of glass pedestrian overpasses. Copley Place Mall great includes the first Neiman Marcus opened in the New England area. The system of overpasses extends over half a mile from the Prudential Center and the shops that surround it. The 52-story Prudential Tower, thought a marvel in 1964, is considered by some ugly. However, the Prudential Skywalk observatory offers wonderful views of Back Bay, Boston and its environs. The John Hancock Tower which raises 60 floors and is the tallest building in Boston is a few blocks away. She recently completed nearby skyscrapers are 111 Huntington Ave (36 floors, completed in 2002) and Clarendon (32 floors, completed in 2009). The residential streets of Back Bay are some of the best preserved examples of 19th century urban architecture in the U.S. Copley Square, surrounded by Clarendon, Boylston, Dartmouth, and St. James streets, includes Trinity Church, Boston Public Library, the John Hancock Tower, and other fine examples of architecture. The \"Back Bay Historic District\" was included on the National Register of Historic Places on 14 August 1973. The Prudential Center has awarded the Urban Land Institute Award for Best Mixed-use goods in 2006. The monumental building, for the first time in the square was the Museum of Fine Arts building. Initiated in 1870 and opened in 1876, with much of its collection taken from the Ateneo Art Gallery in Boston. The construction of Gothic Revival red was demolished and rebuilt as the Copley Plaza Hotel still exists today. If you are looking for fine shopping and upper scale dining venues this neighborhood has a lot to offer.

The answer was to unload cargo directly onto the beach. The exigencies of war, along with the expertise and old fashioned Yankee ingenuity combined to create the perfect solution - a vehicle that was half boat and half truck that could run on land and water. Code-named: DUKW. The first \"duck\" was actually a GMC truck enclosed in a water-tight shell. It was not long before DUKWs played a crucial role in the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Pacific and the largest invasion of all, D-Day. In fact, over 40% of all beach supplies in Normandy were transported by DUKWs during the first four months. Boston Duck Tours operates a fleet of restored World War II DUKWs. These amphibious vehicles played an important role in both theaters of Europe and the Pacific war. The Boston Duck Tours and Museum of Science Boston have joined together to present the history of these remarkable vehicles. A special exhibit includes a history of the DUKW, photographs, vintage posters and films. General Motors built 21,000 DUKWs during the war. The display also includes a fully restored Seep. It looks like a miniature DUKW but is actually one of the 12,000 amphibious Jeeps built by Ford Motor Company during World War II. This special exhibit is located in the Science Museum, near the cockpit of Boston Duck Tours ticket. In recent years, Boston Duck Tours has begun to replace the original DUKWs with DUKWs that are easier to maintain and operate. The Boston Duck Tours fleet currently consists of original DUKWs that house 32 people with a new open air deck for the last 8 seats and DUKWs time guests are 36 and are completely closed. DUKWs currently have 15 original and 9 DUKWs at a time. The DUKW type you choose depends on the size of your group and timing of your trip. The Duck Tours has three convenient points of departure including the Museum of Science at 1 Science Park, the Prudential Center in Boston\\'s Back Bay at 53 Huntington Avenue, and the New England Aquarium at 1 Central Wharf. Operating season runs from March 23 through November 29 each year. The tour runs on each weekend throughout December as well. The tours from the Prudential Center and the Museum of Science operate seven days a week rain or shine. Weather does not prevent the tours from these locations from happening. Each tour is approximately 80 minutes when departing from the Prudential Center or Museum of Science and 55 minutes when departing from the New England Aquarium. The tours begin at 9:00 am and the last tour from the Museum of Science and Prudential Center leaves an hour before sunset. Tours leave every 30 or 60 minutes, depending upon the season.

Situated on one of the world's finest natural harbors,\\n      Boston was once the maritime capital of the colonial United States. Known\\n      variously as the birthplace of the American Revolution, the site of New\\n      England's largest fleet of clipper ships, meeting place of\\n      America's literati, and home of many venerable educational and\\n      cultural institutions, Boston remains the largest city in the six New\\n      England states. During the 1980s, Boston gained fame as a high technology\\n      and defense research center, as well as a good place in which to conduct\\n      business. This was in part attributable to the vast network of research\\n      facilities connected with schools in the region. Since the economic\\n      downturn that occurred in 1988 through 1992, the city has been enjoying an\\n      economic recovery, with several large ongoing projects that will improve\\n      its infrastructure, including the famous (or to some, infamous) Big Dig.\\n      The city remains one of the country's premier tourist attractions.\\n      In recent years, various sources have ranked Boston among the best large\\n      cities in which to live in the United States.

As in many places across the country, Boston\\'s economy was\\n      affected by the events on September 11, 2001. Especially hit were the\\n      travel, financial services and high technology sectors, which alone lost\\n      nearly 32,000 jobs between 2001 and 2003. Loss of jobs in those areas\\n      leveled off in 2004 and began to regain some lost ground, especially in\\n      tourism. Other sectors such as education and health care were not as hard hit.\\n      While manufacturing in Boston has lost some ground, it remains an\\n      important sector of the economy and is joined by several other traditional\\n      industries and some new ones. Boston is considered one of the top places\\n      in which to do business in the United States. Major industries include\\n      finance, high-technology research and development, tourism, medicine,\\n      education, commercial fishing, food processing, printing and publishing,\\n      and government. Early in its history, Boston made its name as a center for the processing\\n      of wool and the manufacture of clothing, textiles, shoes, and leather\\n      goods. While the shoe and textile industries have suffered in recent\\n      decades, they remain significant contributors to Boston\\'s economy. In the last 20 years, city employment continued to shift from traditional\\n      labor intensive manufacturing jobs to technology and service jobs. The\\n      economy of metropolitan Boston now primarily rests on high technology,\\n      finance, professional and business services, defense, and educational and\\n      medical institutions. The city\\'s economy is more specialized in the\\n      financial, business and professional services and educational and medical\\n      sectors than the suburban economy, which is more specialized in high\\n      technology and the defense industry. Boston\\'s financial district includes major banks such as Fleet\\n      Bank, purchased in 2004 by Bank of America, and investment firms like\\n      Fidelity Investments. Insurance firms such as John Hancock Financial\\n      Services are also a significant presence. Boston is one of the country\\'s top 10 tourist attractions, focusing\\n      on the city\\'s 62 historic sites, its nearly 2,000 restaurants, and\\n      its hundreds of hotels. Tourism is a year-round\\n       industry in Boston, which hosted 16.3 million visitors in 2004, spending\\n      $7.9 billion. The medical schools of both Tufts University and Harvard University are\\n      located in Boston, as is Massachusetts General Hospital, the major\\n      teaching hospital for both schools. Education is a thriving segment of\\n      Boston\\'s economy; within the city limits are 10 colleges and\\n      universities, 6 technical schools, 4 art and music schools, and 6 junior\\n      colleges. In towns and suburbs surrounding Boston, educational\\n      institutions include many prestigious secondary and boarding schools. More than two million pounds of fish are caught in the waters in and\\n      around Boston each year, making fishing, food processing, and food storage\\n      prime industries. Boston is one of the nation\\'s foremost fishing\\n      port and wool market. Both large and small printing operations employ\\n      thousands of workers in the metropolitan area. Boston\\'s print fare\\n      includes several national magazines, scholarly and technical journals, and\\n      the Christian Science publications. For years, Boston has been home to the Atlantic Monthly, one of the oldest literary publications in the United States. As the capital of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Boston is the\\n      workplace of many state and municipal employees. Items and goods produced: machinery, medical and navigational instruments, chemicals, metals,\\n      rubber products and clothing, computers, software, missiles and missile\\n      guidance systems, ships, shoes and boots, textiles. Incentive Programs—New and Existing Companies Local programs Boston\\'s Office of Business Development provides key resources to\\n      support small business development. The office offers a full range of\\n      services—from financial and referral services to business facade\\n      improvement to site finder services—so that each business owner\\n      receives whatever help is needed. Businesses may obtain loans through the\\n      Boston Local Development Corporation, and financing through the Boston\\n      Industrial Development Financing Authority, which issues bonds to finance\\n      the capital needs of Boston businesses. ReStore Boston provides grants and\\n      loans to renovate store fronts, and provides architectural assistance to\\n      do so. The office also has a free Commercial Space for Lease finding\\n      service. State programs The Massachusetts Business Resource Team, under the Executive Office of\\n      Economic Development, exists to help businesses relocate to the state,\\n      expansion of existing businesses, and creation of new businesses. For new\\n      companies, there are Small Business Development Centers in Boston and\\n      across Massachusetts, which advise and educate entrepreneurs. The Capital\\n      Access Program helps businesses secure loans from approved banks.\\n      Expanding or relocating businesses can take advantage of a 3 percent\\n      investment tax credit against the corporate excise tax for the\\n      construction of manufacturing facilities, or the purchase or lease of\\n      equipment. Businesses moving to an \"economic opportunity\\n      area\" or an \"economically distressed area\" have\\n      access to special tax credits and incentive programs. For manufacturers\\n      looking for working capital, the Economic Stabilization Trust can provide\\n      funds to help get the business on the road to recovery. For businesses\\n      willing to move or expand into brownfield areas, Massachusetts provides\\n      low cost assessment and remediation programs, and alternative financing\\n      options. Technology firms can receive assistance with the Research and\\n      Development Tax Credit and the Emerging Technology fund, which provides\\n      loans for specialized equipment purchases and R & D,, and\\n      biotechnology companies can receive funds for new job creation through the\\n      Jobs Creation Incentive Payment. All businesses can take advantage of\\n      Safety Training grants for education to improve workplace safety. The\\n      Massachusetts Export Center provides counseling, education and technical\\n      assistance for businesses in global markets. For business involved in the\\n      fishing industry, Seafood Loans assist in the construction or renovations\\n      of buildings or equipment. Job training programs Boston\\'s Office of Jobs and Community Service (JCS) receives\\n      funding from the U.S. Department of Labor, HUD, and the Massachusetts\\n      Departments of Education and Transitional Assistance. The state provides\\n      matching grants from the Workplace Training Fund to pay for employee\\n      training. The state\\'s 32 One-Stop Career Centers provide job\\n      finding assistance and career counseling for potential employees; and\\n      listing services, job fairs, and recruiting assistance for employers. JCS\\n      provides planning and oversight to a large network of community-based\\n      organizations who provide residents with a rich variety of training\\n      programs. These include basic education, GED and diploma programs, English\\n      as a Second Language, job readiness, and a variety of skills training.\\n      Additionally, JCS is a partner in a one-stop career center called The Work\\n      Place, which coordinates the functions of the Boston Neighborhood Jobs\\n      Trust, oversees various human service programs, and houses Read Boston, a\\n      major literacy initiative to ensure that all children are\\n      reading-proficient by the third grade. There are incentive grants for\\n      training when hiring an unemployed worker, or someone receiving public\\n      assistance. Development Projects The real estate market in Boston continues to thrive with multi-million\\n      dollar projects. A special focus is development of the South Boston\\n      Waterfront area, and the Fort Point Channel Arts District. Artists for\\n      Humanity has a new \"green,\" environmentally-aware 23,500\\n      square foot center providing studio and gallery space for teaching art to\\n      inner-city youth. In 2006, construction will begin on a 22,000\\n       square foot addition to Boston\\'s Children\\'s Museum, also in\\n      South Boston. Nearby will be a 400-room Marriot Renaissance Hotel,\\n      expected to cost $140 million, which will open in 2007. Boston Harbor\\n      Residences, a high-end, two-tower rental and condominium development,\\n      opens in 2005. Breaking ground in 2005 is the massive $230 million Battery\\n      Wharf mixed-use project in the North End, which will be composed of four\\n      buildings and include high-end condos and the luxury Regent Boston hotel. In 2004, the Onyx Hotel, a hip, pet-friendly boutique hotel, opened in\\n      North Station. The Saltonstall office building at 100 Cambridge St. was\\n      completely overhauled, and in 2004 re-opened as a 279,000 square foot\\n      mixed-use tower of condominiums, office and retail space. In the Fenway\\n      neighborhood, Trilogy, a $200-million, 651,000-square-foot mixed use\\n      development, broke ground in 2004 to bring housing, 42,000 square feet of\\n      retail space, and underground parking to Boylston St. and Brookline Ave.\\n      Construction will begin soon on a new emergency and trauma center for the\\n      UMass Memorial Medical Center, in Worchester, which is expected to cost\\n      $129 million. In the Longwood Medical Area, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical\\n      Center will start construction on a 700,000 square foot research center,\\n      the first building of which will open in 2007. Also in Longwood, the\\n      Massachusetts Mental Health Center will get a $200 million make-over in\\n      2005, adding medical offices, research space, and housing, both market\\n      value and low-income apartments. A new Intercontinental Hotel at 500\\n      Atlantic Avenue will feature 424 hotel rooms on the first 12 floors, with\\n      luxury condos on the floors above, in a $255 million development.

In 2004\\n      the port handled 1.3 million tons of general cargo, 1.5 million tons of\\n      non-fuels bulk cargo and 12.8 million tons of bulk fuel. Boston\\'s\\n      popularity as a port is easily understood: it accommodates even the\\n      largest ocean going freighters. One of the best natural harbors in the\\n      United States, the Fort Point Channel is 40 feet deep and 7 miles long.\\n      Nearly 40 miles of docks and wharves line the shores of Boston\\'s\\n      inner harbor, mainly between South Boston and Charlestown. The\\n      Massachusetts Port Authority operates the docks. Facilities include the Conley Container Terminal, the center of container\\n      handling, with 2000 feet of berthing space; Boston Autoport, processing\\n      nearly 100,000 cars a year; Commonwealth Pier, a huge dry dock in South\\n      Boston; and Fish Pier, one of the world\\'s largest and oldest in the\\n      country. Cruiseport and Black Falcon Cruise Terminal is a stopping point\\n      for 15 cruise lines, such as Norwegian and Cunard. Boston\\'s\\n      shipping needs are also accommodated by the network of highways running\\n      through and around the city, a large commercial trucking fleet, railroads,\\n      and delivery services. Labor Force and Employment Outlook As the home of world-renowned colleges and universities, Boston boasts a\\n      highly educated work force. The minority population, including the\\n      Hispanic population, is on the increase. Educational institutions are an\\n      important source of new, highly skilled professionals for the\\n      city\\'s labor force. Wages in the Boston area tend to be high, as are taxes and office lease\\n      rates. Entrepreneurial software and biotechnology companies attracted to\\n      the assets of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have tended to\\n      locate in East Cambridge, just across the Charles River from Boston.\\n      Analysts have given the city high marks in recent years for improvements\\n      in management, and a strong academic and research base should continue to\\n      stand Boston in good stead. The following is a summary of data regarding the Boston metropolitan NECTA\\n      labor force, 2004 annual averages.

The high cost of housing\\n      contributes to the overall expense. According to the Tax Institute, in\\n      2005 Massachusetts residents had a much lower state and local tax burden\\n      than they used to: the state now ranked 32nd in the nation, and its\\n      personal income tax ranked it 12th lowest among states who have an income\\n      tax.

They named the peninsula\\n      \"Shawmut,\" which meant variously \"land accessible by\\n      water\" in reference to the harbor or \"land with living\\n      fountains,\" a comment on the area\\'s abundant fresh water\\n      springs. When two-thirds of the native population succumbed to a European\\n      disease against which they carried no immunity, the way was clear for\\n      transAtlantic settlers. The area\\'s first white settler from across the Atlantic arrived on\\n      the peninsula in the 1620s. William Blackstone, an English clergyman, was\\n      the leader of a small band who eventually returned to England, leaving\\n      Blackstone alone in his home atop what was later Boston\\'s Beacon\\n      Hill. Blackstone and subsequent English settlers eventually became\\n      friendly with the local native tribes, whose democratic form of tribal\\n      governance, some historians claim, influenced the country\\'s\\n      founding fathers in their conception of the Declaration of Independence\\n      and U.S. Constitution. Boston was founded in 1630 by a Protestant religious sect called the\\n      Puritans. They named the new town for their former home in Lincolnshire,\\n      England. The same year, Boston was declared the capital of the\\n      Massachusetts Bay Colony. Bounded on three sides by water, Boston soon\\n      became the colonies\\' major New England seaport and the largest\\n      British settlement on the continent as well. When the Massachusetts Bay\\n      Colony\\'s charter was revoked in 1684, Boston for the first time was\\n      subject to direct British authority. Although unused to trans-Atlantic interference in their affairs,\\n      Bostonians nevertheless enjoyed a flowering of thought and culture never\\n      allowed during the years of strict Puritan dominance. As it developed into\\n      a major colonial center, Boston was the site of the calling of the\\n      nation\\'s first Grand Jury in 1635; the opening of the\\n      nation\\'s oldest school, the Boston Latin School, in 1635; the\\n      building of the first post office in 1639; the chartering of the\\n      colonies\\' first bank in 1674; the publication of the\\n      nation\\'s oldest newspaper, Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick, banned after one issue in 1690; and the publishing of the nation\\'s\\n      first long-running newspaper, the Boston News-Letter, in 1704. By 1750, Boston\\'s population was 15,000 people. Revolution Precedes Maritime Supremacy Continued protest over the British Crown\\'s introduction of a series\\n      of unpopular taxes (including those on stamps and tea) brought British\\n      soldiers to Boston in 1768. The colonists\\' rallying cry soon became\\n      \"No taxation without representation!\" Two years later, in\\n      1770, British soldiers opened fire on a hostile crowd gathered in front of\\n      the Old State House. Five people were killed, including Crispus Attucks, a\\n      mulatto and the first African American to fall in America\\'s fight\\n      for freedom from colonial status. The confrontation, dubbed the\\n      \"Boston Massacre,\" further inflamed Bostonians and patriots\\n      throughout the thirteen colonies. In 1773, Samuel Adams and a group of\\n      followers dressed as Indians carried out the \"Boston Tea\\n      Party\" by emptying the holds of three British ships and dumping\\n      their shipment of taxable tea into Boston Harbor. The British Parliament\\n      responded by closing the port, effectively stifling the city\\'s\\n      economy. Troops of Minutemen began to drill throughout the colonies. Then, in 1775,\\n      ill feeling intensified when colonists learned that the British troops\\n      planned to seize weapons stockpiled in Concord, eighteen miles west of\\n      Boston. On the night of April 18, two lanterns were hung in the belfry of\\n      Boston\\'s Old North Church, signaling that the British were\\n      approaching by land. Silversmith Paul Revere received the message and rode\\n      through the night to warn his colleagues at Concord. Revere was arrested\\n      along the way, but a second rider, Charles Dawes, delivered the warning.\\n      On April 19, British troops found the Minutemen armed and prepared for the\\n      confrontation that would become known as the \"shot heard\\n      \\'round the world.\" It was the first battle of the American\\n      Revolutionary War. Following the Revolution, Boston once again resumed its maritime activity.\\n      Outgoing cargoes included ocean fish and rum from New England and tobacco\\n      from the South. Incoming goods included molasses from the West Indies,\\n      used to distill rum. With the successful resolution of the War of 1812,\\n      Boston began a lucrative trade with China. U.S. ships sailed around Cape\\n      Horn and into the Orient and India, returning to the United States with\\n      tea, silks, and spices. The design of a new and faster vessel, the clipper\\n      ship, further enhanced Boston\\'s maritime supremacy. The invention\\n      of the water-powered loom made Boston an important textile center, and its\\n      wool industry grew to rival England\\'s. Boston received its city charter in 1822 and chose a mayor-council form of\\n      government. The original hilly Shawmut Peninsula upon which the city was\\n      built covered 800 acres surrounded by salt marshes, mudflats, and inlets\\n      of water. As Boston outgrew her site in the 1800s, most of the hills were\\n      leveled and used as fill to create Boston\\'s famous Back Bay\\n      district. Boston\\'s tax base grew when the city annexed neighboring\\n      towns such as Noddle\\'s Island, which was renamed East Boston. In\\n      1821, Boston opened Boston English High School, the nation\\'s oldest\\n      high school. Manufacturing, Finance, Education Take Lead Boston\\'s population remained largely of English descent until the\\n      mid-1800s, when the first waves of European immigrants began to arrive.\\n      The Cabots and Lodges were typical of the leading Puritan families who\\n      became known as the Boston Brahmins. The city experienced an upsurge in\\n      manufacturing around the mid-1800s, aided by the invention of the\\n      railroad. Among the new industries were the making of shoes and other\\n      leather goods, until recently a mainstay of the Boston economy. Irish\\n      peasants seeking refuge from the potato famines in Ireland found work in\\n      Boston\\'s factories and on the wharves. They settled in East Boston\\n      and Charlestown, which remain blue-collar Irish enclaves. From the end of Puritan domination, Boston had been a religiously tolerant\\n      city. In the mid-1800s, Boston became the site of two major movements in\\n      the United States. The Unitarian Church was founded when a portion of\\n      dissatisfied Congregationalists broke away and formed a new sect. The\\n      Unitarian Church, in turn, became a progenitor of the Transcendental\\n      movement of the late nineteenth century. Boston was also the focus of the\\n      New England Anti-Slavery Society, founded in 1832. The Society\\'s\\n      publication, The Liberator, helped identify North-South differences that eventually erupted into the\\n      Civil War. Boston\\'s African American population in the mid-1800s\\n      was sizable, in part because Massachusetts had declared slavery illegal in\\n      1783. By the time of the Civil War, Boston was the center of the\\n      Abolitionist Movement and a stop on the Underground Railroad, which aided\\n      escaping slaves. During the Civil War, Boston supplied 26,000 soldiers and sailors to the\\n      Union and acted as an important military seaport. When the war ended,\\n      Boston\\'s maritime importance diminished, though the city gained\\n      prominence in the world of finance. Meanwhile, intellectuals who gathered\\n      in Boston helped reunite the divided nation. Poets like James Russell\\n      Lowell, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Greenleaf Whittier, along\\n      with novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, jurist Oliver Wendall Holmes,\\n      philosophers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, and historians\\n      William H. Prescott and Francis Parkman wrote about the American spirit\\n      and helped define the American character. It was Holmes who, noting this\\n      concentration of influential thinkers, dubbed Boston the \"hub of\\n      the solar system.\" Set-Backs Countered by Redevelopment By 1900, Boston\\'s population had reached 561,000, partially swelled\\n      by the new wave of Italian immigrants who settled on Boston\\'s North\\n      End. Along with the French-Canadians who arrived next, they combined with\\n      the resident\\n       Irish to make Boston the nation\\'s second largest Roman Catholic\\n      archdiocese. An established population, Boston\\'s Irish began to\\n      figure in municipal politics. John F. \"Honey\" Fitzgerald was\\n      the town\\'s first Irish mayor. He was elected to two terms, in 1906\\n      and again in 1910. He established a political dynasty that included U.S.\\n      President John Fitzgerald Kennedy among his descendants. Fishing, food\\n      processing, shoe making, and wool products were viable Boston industries\\n      at the turn of the century, by which time the demand for ship building had\\n      diminished. Like many of the nation\\'s industrialized cities, Boston\\n      suffered economically between the world wars. First Prohibition, which\\n      made the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages illegal, destroyed\\n      the rum trade, then the Great Depression of the 1930s undermined\\n      Boston\\'s financial market and, finally, New England\\'s\\n      textile industry moved South in search of less expensive labor. At this\\n      time, Boston began to acquire a dual reputation for corrupt machine\\n      politics and racial segregation. The city did a great deal to end\\n      corruption when council seats were declared open in 1951. Racial tension,\\n      however, continues to be a problem in Boston. Tempers flared over\\n      court-ordered pupil busing intended to desegregate the city\\'s\\n      schools, and some Boston neighborhoods have yet to be integrated. Following World War II, Boston\\'s population grew to a peak of\\n      801,000 in 1950, then began to level off and eventually declined. Its\\n      industries were mature and its infrastructure aging. The diminishing tax\\n      base led to an increase in taxes levied and a subsequent loss of the white\\n      middle class population to the suburbs. This trend, however, was countered\\n      in 1957 with the establishment of the Boston Redevelopment Authority,\\n      formed to revitalize the city. Through the efforts of this group, the\\n      Prudential Tower, a major office complex, was built in downtown Boston,\\n      along with a public auditorium, apartments, and office-retail structures.\\n      A new government center was constructed adjacent to historic Faneuil Hall,\\n      and other projects included shopping areas, neighborhood renewal, and\\n      development of water-front and historic districts. Boston also benefitted\\n      from the electronics research industry that emerged in the region in the\\n      1950s. Boston grew rapidly on the strength of its high-tech and defense-related\\n      research industries until the late 1980s. A combination of factors\\n      including high taxes, wages, office lease rates, and housing costs began\\n      to drive businesses to surrounding communities and states. Boston has,\\n      however, received high marks from analysts for its responsible handling of\\n      these and other fiscal problems. A strong economic turnaround which began\\n      around 1993 is continuing into the new century. As host to the Democratic\\n      National Convention in 2004, Boston promotes tourism (always a staple of\\n      its economy) to boost its national image. At the beginning of the new century, Boston\\'s Mayor Tom Menino said\\n      of his city: \"The major challenge facing Boston in the twenty-first\\n      century is that of new prosperity; how to renew Boston in a way that\\n      honors the beautiful historic city left in our care. We are fortunate to\\n      be living in one of those rare times in our City\\'s life, a time\\n      when we have a chance to reinvent Boston and preserve the best of it for\\n      many years to come.\" Today\\'s Boston remains a mecca for\\n      education and culture, and is a forward-looking city steeped in tradition\\n      and history.

With almost two thousand restaurants, Boston offers everything from\\n      traditional seafood dishes to continental and ethnic cuisines. Fresh\\n      saltwater catches include clams, lobster, oysters, bluefish, and scrod.\\n      Boston has been called \"Beantown,\" a term that originated\\n      with the Puritans who, out of respect for the Sabbath, did not cook on\\n      Sunday. Instead, they relied on food prepared the day before, and one\\n      popular menu item was baked beans. Clam and seafood chowders, baked beans,\\n      and Indian pudding are still staples on many Boston menus. Continental cuisine, sometimes blended with American nouvelle cuisine, is\\n      now the specialty of several respected Boston restaurants.

Its location\\n      in Massachusetts Bay puts Boston\\'s airport 200 miles closer to\\n      Europe than New York City. In 2005, Logan was ranked the nation\\'s\\n      19th busiest airport; it is served by 39 airlines. Logan can be reached by\\n      car, by public transportation on the \"T\" Blue Line, and by\\n      water aboard the Airport Water Shuttle. Boston\\'s access routes by automobile include Interstate-90, the\\n      Massachusetts Turnpike, which is the major east-west artery. Massachusetts\\n      Service Route 9, another east-west road, accommodates suburban traffic.\\n      I-93 runs north-south through Boston where it is called the Northeast\\n      Expressway. Encircling the city is Massachusetts Service Route 128. More\\n      than seven hundred high-technology firms have established facilities along\\n      Massachusetts SR 128 and I-495, making them heavily traveled freeways. Boston can also be reached by railroad and by bus. The city is served by\\n      three Amtrak lines: the Downeaster connects Boston with Portland, Maine;\\n      the Regional, serving cities along the coast south to Newport News,\\n      Virginia.; and the Acela Express, a 150-mph train that makes the trip from\\n      Washington, D.C. in 7 hours. South Station and North Station, the Amtrak\\n      and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority terminals, are on opposite\\n      sides of Boston\\'s downtown business district. Those arriving by\\n      Greyhound/Trailways and Peter Pan Bus Lines disembark at the Greyhound Bus\\n      Terminal downtown. Traveling in the City Boston is a very walkable city, and walking tours depart from a number of\\n      locations. According to local sources, driving in Boston can be a\\n      confusing experience even for natives. Heavy traffic, narrow one-way\\n      streets, limited parking, traffic rotaries, and jay-walking pedestrians\\n      combine to make driving difficult in Boston, especially in the downtown\\n      area. Most residents leave their cars at home and ride Boston\\'s\\n      superb public transportation, known as the \"T.\" This rapid\\n      transit system includes elevated lines, subways, and surface routes.\\n      Trolleys, street cars, and buses supplement the \"T.\" Private\\n      transportation includes Amtrak commuter trains, taxis, and ferry boats. The \"T\" is operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation\\n      Authority (MBTA). Boston\\'s system is the oldest in the country, and\\n      all five lines converge downtown. Boston is one of only five U.S. cities\\n      to use trolleys and street cars as a regular part of its transportation\\n      system.

The first professional sports team to call the arena home was the Boston Bruins ice hockey team. For seventy years it would not only host thousands of regular season and championship games but also numerous civic and artistic events. Among the speakers that addressed a packed arena over the years were world leaders like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy. World class performing artists that played the Boston Garden included James Brown, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin and scores of others. The \"Greatest Shows on Earth\\'\\' when in Boston, like the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus would be found at this indoor stadium. The most talked about legend of the Garden however, was the parquet floor on which the NBA team, the Boston Celtics, play. Said floor was installed in 1946 at the Boston Arena, with wood extracted from the forests of Tennessee by the Boston Lumber Company. The floor is said to have cost $11,000. At that time, the Celtics played their home games interchangeably at both the Boston Arena (which would later become the Matthews Arena) and the Boston Garden. In 1952 that floor was moved to the Boston Garden, which from that moment on became the exclusive home court of the Celtics until 1995, when the building was closed forever. The Celtics\\' parquet floor was the only part of the old structure however, that was moved to the new venue, initially named the Fleet Center. The Fleet Center opened on September 30, 1995, with a construction cost of 160 million dollars. It was built on 3.2-acres just nine inches away from the site of the original facility with a 19,580 capacity. In 1997 the old building was demolished. Over the years a myth had evolved around the Celtics frequent ability to compete for the championship based in the parquet floor. It was a said that the team could predict which way the ball would bounce off of any given section. But in late 1999 the last game was played on the old floor, (much of which, in reality, had been replaced over the years, one section at a time, due to damages from use.). On January 3, of 2000, a new floor was inaugurated beneath the treads of the team, although some sections of the old parquet floor have been recycled into this new floor, keeping this urban myth alive. The Parquet floor aside, the home team did have a distinct advantage in the original Boston Garden. The fans sat much closer to the players than in most stadiums as part of the design by boxing promoter Tex Rickard, who wanted the fans to see the sweat dripping off of two opponents in the ring. While this may have raised team morale for home players it almost surely hurt morale for visiting teams when the Boston fans got angry and were that much closer to the area of play. Despite that advantage, the old stadium had many problems like continuous electrical failures, no air conditioning and a non-regulation size hockey ring. The new facility was built to overcome the flaws in order to make fans even more comfortable at sporting events and other activities in a modern setting. Due to popular demand, by 2005 it was agreed to change the new buildings name to TD Banknorth Garden, which was immediately restored to Boston Garden by Bostonians. Today the Boston Garden continues to be home to the National Hockey League team of the Boston Bruins, the National Basket Ball Association team of the Boston Celtics and the National Lacrosse League team of the Boston Blazers. In addition to hosting major sports, music and entertainment events the multi-purpose arena already hosted a major political event, the 2004 Democratic National Convention. The facility received major upgrades only 10 years after it was built. In 2006, 20 million dollars were spent on, among other things, the construction of a 20,000 foot expansion of the North Station train concourse below the stadium and the installation of the first high definition scoreboard. With the local recognition and prestige of this name since 1928, any world class event in the City of Boston will continue to be held at the Boston Garden for the coming decades. 1 Cat Dec 10, 2010 @ 8:20 pm I just bet my friend $100.00 that the ice in the old garden was melted and drained prior to installation the parquet floor so the Celtics could play B-ball.  Please tell tell me I am correct otherwise  I\\'m out a C-note.

Boston, Massachusetts is a large city with many stores, shops, restaurants, and things to do. Copley Place is just one place visitors and residents may wish to go. This particular shopping mall is currently under the Simon Property Group management company. Simon is perhaps the largest retail real estate company in North America.

It was a large complex with office buildings, hotels, and a parking garage. The mall itself caters to upscale stores such as Ralph Lauren, Christian Dior, Porsche Design, Tiffany and Co., Jimmy Choo, Louis Vuitton, David Yurman, and Salvatore Ferragamo. The mall is also connected with Shops at Prudential Center that houses Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord and Taylor, Shaw's Supermarket and Barnes and Noble. The connection is made with a skybridge. The location of the mall places it on the MBTA station for the underground in Boston. An expansion may be underway in the next few months once plans are finalized. Neiman Marcus may be seeing 54,000 square feet added on, and a 60,000 square foot expansion has been asked for to open new stores and restaurants. One of the anchor stores not yet discussed is Barneys New York. Among the stores that have already been listed there is Burberry, Armani, Stuart Weitzman, Tourneau, Bally, Thomas Pink, Elie Tahari, Coach, Kenneth Cole, Hugo Boss, and Mont Blanc.

The nearly 50-acre Boston Common was established in 1634, initially for common pasture land. It was also the site of public hangings and was used for military purposes. During the war for independence it was the site of the British troop encampment prior to their departure in April of 1775 to the renowned battle of Lexington and Concord. Monuments to the War for Independence and dozens of other landmarks fill the downtown area and the park itself. The Visitor\\'s Center in Boston Common is the departure point to see those sites along the Freedom Trail, which many a visitor and most Bostonians have embarked upon at least once. In past decades this park has served as the site of a diversity of major public speakers including Gloria Steinem, Martin Luther King Jr., and Pope John Paul II. It has also been the site for Boston activists to organize public demonstrations and protests throughout the last 100 years. Since March of 2008, debate has begun around limiting the number of large events allowed to occur in the park in order to limit the impact on the ecosystem and the parks natural beauty. It is the hills of the Boston Common where city children sled in the winter and skate on the frozen \"frog pond.\\'\\' In hot months that same skating rink becomes a wading pool, with sprinkler jets that cool the kids, giving parents some quiet time in the midst of a family picnic. Like any major city park, the summer is a scene of concerts, rollerblading and biking as well as the best people watching that Boston can offer. Of course the gallows were removed and the grazing came to a halt in the first half of the 19th century, prior to the public park system being created as such. Indeed it was in 1850 when the idea for a public park system first emerged. At that time the Boston Common was the only such public space. Finally in 1867 a law for Boston parks was approved by the Massachusetts State Legislature. Several years went by before, between 1878 and 1896, the Emerald necklace was created, based on the plan of the leading landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. The necklace, which is anchored by Boston Common and the neighboring Public Garden is a seven-mile semi-circle of interconnected green spaces throughout Boston. While many rural areas are only a short trip outside of the city, the Boston Common and surrounding parks take the edge off city-life and by providing an oasis in the heart of this urban center.

Welcoming more than 1.3 million visitors annually, the New England Aquarium focuses much of its efforts on oceanic conservation and environmental awareness. It is home to over 20,000 animals divided among 600 species. Being one of the bigger tourist draws in the area, the New England Aquarium hosts a number of educational and entertaining programs to teach visitors about aquatic animal life and environmental issues. The aquarium itself maintains an active involvement in conservation, hosting a number of programs that help the environment recover from issues such as global warming and pollution. The New England Aquarium supports programs that protect the rare and endangered North Atlantic right whale, prevents the destruction of the Amazonian rainforests, and studies the effects of global warming on the Earth\\'s oceans and sea life. The New England Aquarium boasts a 200,000 gallon tank that emulates a Caribbean coral reef, serving as a home to countless fish and other sea life, such as sharks and sea turtles. The Giant Ocean Tank is cylindrical in shape, and is surrounded by 52 windows that allow visitors to see its inhabitants from an array of angles. Also present is a 150,000 gallon penguin exhibit, where several species of penguins swim and play to the amusement of patrons to the aquarium. There are also smaller tanks, such as \"Thinking\\'\\' Gallery, a Freshwater tank, and the \"Edge of the Sea\\'\\' tide pool, which lets visitors touch and interact with various sea life, ranging from sea urchins to horseshoe crabs. The Northern Waters of the World Gallery explores Northeastern oceanic habitats and compares them with Pacific Northwestern habitats. A Tropical Gallery is also available, featuring a plethora of colorful fish and ocean life. Free for all visitors is the Harbor Seal exhibit. Sea mammal training sessions are also available to the public eye, and aquarium attendees can view animal feedings and tank dives throughout the week. The New England Aquarium is also home to its own IMAX Theater, offering patrons a cinematic learning experience like no other. The Simons IMAX Theater has been host to a number of special screenings of aquarium-exclusive educational programs. In 2007, the aquarium launched a new program, named \"Killer Instincts\\'\\', designed to educate patrons about the sea animals people tend to fear, such as electric eels, sharks, barracudas, and giant octopuses. The annual David B. Stone award is issued by the aquarium to individuals, groups, or organizations that show their commitment to aiding in oceanic conservation and protection. Created in 1970, this award honors aquarium founder David B. Stone. Another event held by the aquarium is the Blue Planet Ball. The Blue Planet Ball is a yearly fundraiser where people gather for a fun night and to express their support for the aquarium. The New England Aquarium offers special ticket packages for students and tour groups at discounted prices. Tickets can be purchased online or at the aquarium ticket booth, and visitors can call 617-973-5200 for more information about tickets and hours of operation.

The Public Garden was established in 1837 when philanthropist Horace Gray asked for the use of land as the first public botanical garden in the United States. Gray helped to marshal political resistance to a number of Boston City Council is trying to sell the land in question, finally resolve the question of devoting the public garden in 1856. The Act establishing the land use was submitted to the voters on April 26, 1856 where it passed with only 99 dissents. Today the north side of the lake is a small island, but originally was a peninsula, connected to land. The site became so popular with fans of the John Galvin, the city forester, decided to cut the connection to the earth. The landscape of twenty-four hectares, which was once a marsh, was designed by George F. Meacham. The paths and flower beds were placed by the city engineer, James Slade and Forestry, John Galvin. The plan for the garden includes a series of fountains and statues. The first statue was erected by Edward Everett William Wetmore Story, in November 1867 in the northern part of the garden, near Beacon Street. The bronze statue of George Washington by Thomas Ball, which dominates the west side of the park, was dedicated on 3 July 1869. The firm suspension bridge in the middle of the lake was built in 1867. The public garden is run jointly between the Office of the Mayor, the Parks Department of the City of Boston, and friends of the non-profit public gardens. It was declared a National Historic Monument in 1987. Along with the Boston Common, these two parks form the northern terminus of the Emerald Necklace, a string of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. While the common open space is largely unstructured, the Public Garden contains a lake and a series of formal plantings that are maintained by the city and others, and vary from season to season. During the warmer seasons, the four acre pond is usually the home of one or more of the swans and is always the site of the Swan Boats, a famous tourist attraction in Boston. For a small fee, tourists can sit on a boat decorated with a white swan in the back. The boat is then pedaled around the lake by a tour guide sitting on the swan. The Public Garden is rectangular and is bounded on the south by Boylston Street, west of Arlington Street, and north of Beacon Street, where it faces Beacon Hill. On its east side, Charles Street divides the common public garden. The greenway that connects the public garden, with the rest of the Emerald Necklace is a strip of park that runs west through the center of Commonwealth Avenue to the marshes of Back Bay and the river of mud.

Chinatown is one of the most densely populated residential districts in the Boston area, with a reported 28,000 people per square mile in the year 2000. Nearly 70% of the population is Asia's Chinatown, with an average household income of $14,289. The only historic Chinese site in New England is Chinatown and the area is located in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. Focused on Beach Street, the neighborhood borders along Boston Common and Downtown Crossing. To the far south is Highway Southeast or Massachusetts Turnpike. Part of it occupies a floor space reclaimed by filling the tides or tidal flat and the newly built area was first settled by the Anglo-Bostonians. After residential properties in this area became less desirable due to the development of railways, which was settled by a mixed sequence of Ireland, the Jewish immigrants, Italian, Syrian, and Chinese. Each group replaces the former to take advantage of low cost housing and employment opportunities in the area. During the late nineteenth century, the manufacturing plants of clothing also moved to Chinatown, the garment creation of the historic district of Boston. The garment district was active until the 1990s. Negotiations culminated in the provision of funds for the construction of new housing in the Chinatown community. During this period, city officials also designated an area adjacent to Chinatown and Boston's red light district, also known as the combat zone. The traditional Chinatown Gate (paifang) with foo lion on each side is at the intersection of Beach Street and the road surface. The Gate is visible from the southern bus terminal and is a popular tourist destination and great photo opportunity. Chinatown offers excellent local and regional transport. It is served by the MBTA Red Line, Silver Line and Commuter Rail station in the south and the Orange Line station in Chinatown. Interstate 93 and the Massachusetts Turnpike are close behind. Two Chinese-owned bus services (Fung Wah and Lucky Star / Travel pack) provide hourly connections with New York's Chinatown. Tufts Medical Center overlooks part of the area and includes a full-service hospital and health facility associated with various schools including Tufts University, Tufts University School of Medicine, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine. In addition, South Cove Community Health Center Chinatown Clinic operates at 885 Washington Avenue. South Cove volunteers founded it in 1972, to provide better health care for Asian Americans in the Chinatown area. In recent years, a new satellite Chinatown has been rapidly emerging approximately 10 miles south on Hancock Street in the nearby city of Quincy. This is due to the rapid influx of Hokkien-speaking mainland Chinese immigrants from Fujian Province and a large and growing population of Vietnamese origin. There are already several large Asian supermarkets, such as food and Man Kam Super 88 supermarket chains and other businesses that compete with Boston's Chinatown. Several companies operating in Chinatown now have branches in Quincy.

Local residents and long-term Boston residents include many neighborhoods within the downtown region as well as much of the financial district. In Boston, this seems to be par for the course. Like most areas within Boston, the district has no official definitive borders and boundaries. It is roughly bounded by Atlantic Avenue, State Street and Devonshire Street. Parts of the district are in different postal USPS ZIP Codes including 02108, 02109, 02110, and 02111. T subway station at Atlantic Avenue and State Street is officially designated the Aquarium, Financial, or Downtown District. The area includes Post Office Square, the international exchange complex, Plaza Place, and the historic Custom House Tower which is now a private condominium. The district also contains the headquarters of the mutual fund companies Fidelity Investments, Putnam Investments and DWS Scudder Investments, the global headquarters of State Street Bank, Boston Stock Exchange, the accounting firm RSM McGladrey, Judge swap loan debt, the law firms of Goodwin Procter, WilmerHale, Kirkpatrick & Lockhart Nicholson Graham, and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, PC; the local headquarters of Bank of America (formerly Fleet Bank) and Sovereign Bank, Langham Boston Hotel and the Hilton Hotel, and local offices of Merrill Lynch and other firms. Dewey Square at One Financial Center, and the Square Towers housing the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is located near South Station, adjacent and south of the area defined above. Also, part of the financial district is 33 Arch Street with a Federal, the First National Bank of Building Construction, and also 101 Federal Street. The area contains many of the skyscrapers of Boston in a rather dense, much more than the Back Bay, which contains two tallest skyscrapers in Boston, Prudential Center and John Hancock Tower. Many of the skyscrapers of the financial district range up in the heights of 500 feet and most rise above 40 stories high. There are also numerous proposals for the area and many skyscrapers are under construction in the area. Russia Wharf is currently the highest building, reaching 32 floors and 395 meters when completed. South Station Tower has been approved for the area above the South Station and will rise to 41 floors and 621 meters. Other proposals that would modify and expand the horizon of national transport include Boston Place, which would amount to 1,175 feet to become one of the nation's tallest skyscrapers. There were also some other proposals such as the Congress Street towers, and towers of aquarium Garage Woud both be over 50 floors and at least 500 feet. State Street Corporation is headquartered at One Lincoln Street building. Fish & Richardson is based in the State Street Bank building in the Financial District. In 2009, Fish & Richardson agreed to lease space in a Marine Park in South Boston as its new headquarters and leave its current headquarters. It will move from the third quarter in 2010.

The community was created by connecting several islands, using landfill and then was annexed by Boston in 1836. East Boston is separated from the rest of the city by Boston Harbor and bordered by Winthrop, Revere, Chelsea and the creek. Directly west of East Boston across Boston Harbor is the North End and Boston\\'s financial district. The neighborhood has long provided a foothold for the latest wave of immigrants, Irish, Russian Jews and Italians and then alternating the predominant group. Today, immigrants from El Salvador, Brazil and elsewhere in Central and South America East Boston have made a center of Latino culture in New England. In East Boston, which some call \"EASTI\" the demographic has changed to predominantly Hispanic, and the once important Italian population still lives in areas such as Orient Heights. While East Boston has a spectacular view of the city skyline, the rental prices of the community and property values have risen more slowly than the extraordinary increase witnessed in the rest of the metropolitan area of Boston during the 1990s and early 2000. This slower growth can be attributed to factors such as the isolated nature of the neighborhood, difficulties of real estate development along the coast and the negative attitude towards the local Logan Airport East Boston residents. Sites in the neighborhood that are popular with tourists and locals are: Sanctuary of the Madonna and Don Orione - One of the most recognizable icons of East Boston is the 35-foot-high statue of the Virgin. The Madonna Shrine, atop Orient Heights, is the national headquarters of the Don Orione order. Built in 1954, the statue is a scale replica of the one at the Don Orione Center in the district of Monte Mario in Rome, Italy. It was built in 1954 by Jewish and Italian sculptor Arrigo Minerbi, who wanted to show his gratitude to the Catholic Church for having shielded him and his family from the Nazis during World War II. Across the street from the Shrine is the Don Orione Home, a nursing home, as the Sanctuary, was founded by the Don Orione priests. Suffolk Downs - Powered by Route 1 and a blue line stop, Suffolk Downs was opened in 1935 and the point considered modern, although it now seems dated. For years they have held a Grade II event at the track called the MassCap. More recently, the issue has complained that revenues have been drained as a result of Indian casinos in Rhode Island and Connecticut and have canceled the MassCap. On 18 August 1966, the Beatles played a concert before some 24,000 music fans in the box Suffolk Downs. Piers Park - Piers Park is on the west side of East Boston and overlooks Boston Harbor with downtown Boston in the background. The park consists of meandering brick promenades with open grass and tree sections. There are several pavilions, one of which is dedicated to Donald McKay. Along with the amphitheater, there is a community sailing program, Piers Park Sailing Center.

Located at 4 Yawkey Way, the park has served as the home stadium of the club\\'s baseball team, Boston Red Sox, since it opened in 1912 and is the oldest stadium in Major League Baseball currently in use. It is the only ballpark of the original standards that are still in use today. Due to the limited age and location of the park in an urban neighborhood next to the large campus of the University of Boston, the park has had many renovations and additions in recent years not originally planned for. This resulted in unique and peculiar architecture and landscape which was known as \"the Triangle \",\" Pesky Pole\" and especially the famous Green Monster in left field. Fenway Park is known for hosting dedicated Red Sox fans, so-called \"Red Sox Nation. Every Red Sox home game since May 15, 2003, has been sold, in 2008; the park sold its 456th consecutive game the Red Sox, breaking a record in the majors. Fenway Park has also been the site of other sporting and cultural events, including professional football games for the Boston Redskins and the Boston Patriots, concerts and political campaigns. On 15 May 1999 then CEO of the Red Sox, John Harrington, announced plans for a new Fenway Park to be built near the existing structure. It should have the same dimensions in the field, are a green monster, basically a replica of the existing fleet, but was upgraded to replace some of the features of old Fenway Park. Some sections of the old Fenway Park would be preserved (mainly the original Green Monster and the third base side of the park) as part of the new overall design. Most of the old park would be demolished to make room for new development, with a section that is at the home of a baseball museum and a public park. This was a very controversial idea, as most fans consider Boston area sports Fenway Park to be sacred ground, and demolition of the old park that have caused significant distress. Various groups emerged, such as \"Save Fenway Park\" to try to block the move. All parties discussed for several years about the details of the new stadium. One plan even involved the construction of a \"Sports Megaplex\" in South Boston, where a new Fenway Park would be located next to a new stadium for the New England Patriots. The Patriots ultimately built a new stadium in Foxboro, and that the plan was abandoned. Even after several more rounds of discussions, the Red Sox could not reach an agreement with the city of Boston for a new stadium. In 2005, the group owning the Red Sox announced that the team would remain at the current Fenway Park indefinitely. Before the 2008 season, Fenway Park\\'s capacity was increased to 39,928, where it remains for additional renovations following the 2009 season, Fenway representation as the smallest room, behind the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Tropicana Field and PNC Park. Renewal before the 2009 season now allow the Sox to sell tickets for about 350 more each game, although the official capacity has not increased.

While a neighborhood may be considered for administrative purposes, this one actually consists of numerous neighborhoods with two very different feels, and is rarely regarded as a single entity. Locals call the neighborhood \"The Fenway,\" and \"Kenmore Square\" or simply \"Kenmore.\\'\\' In addition, the Fenway neighborhood is divided into two distinct sub districts commonly referred to as the East Fenway/Symphony and Fenway Park West. Fenway is the name of The Fenway, a principal avenue established by Frederick Law Olmsted. The neighborhood is home to Fenway Park, the famous Citgo sign, Kenmore Square, the Art Institute of Boston, the Forsyth Institute, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Northeastern University in the New England Conservatory, the portions of the University Boston (including Myles Standish Residence), part of Harvard Medical School, Berklee College of Music, Boston Conservatory, Massachusetts College of Art, Wentworth Institute of Technology, Simmons College, Wheelock College, Emmanuel College, the New England School of Photography, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Fenway Park is a neighborhood on the south by Mission Hill, Back Bay Fens and Columbus Avenue in the north by the Mass Pike, and west by Mission Hill. The district consists almost entirely of five to six story apartment buildings with small independently owned shops scattered throughout. Race, Fenway is predominantly white but also has a large population of Asian Americans and African. East Fenway remains largely populated while Fenway West was formerly known as a haven for students because of its proximity to many city colleges and universities, but due to growing interest in the area and the high rents, has become full of young professionals and families of many of whom work in the neighboring Longwood Medical and Academic Area. The crime rate in the neighborhood remains relatively low. Kenmore is located north and west of Fenway Park, and shares many of the same attributes of Fenway. Fenway Park is actually located in Kenmore, across the Mass Pike from Kenmore Square. Many students from nearby Boston University and Northeastern University reside in the neighborhood. The area is almost entirely brick, walk-up buildings and brownstone houses, although in the last 20 years almost every residential building in Kenmore has been purchased by Boston University and became the dormitories, especially in the area Audubon Circle between Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue. Fenway Park is separated from the Back Bay by the Muddy River, which flows through the Back Bay Fens and the Charles River. The neighborhood is served by the MBTA Green Line, with stops at Hynes, Kenmore, Fenway, Symphony, Northeastern and the Museum of Fine Arts. Fenway Kenmore is served by a number of MBTA buses. The Fenway Park Drive circulates around the marshes. Boylston Street is a major east-west and Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue, crossing in Kenmore Square. Huntington Avenue (Route 9) is located on the southern border.

The neighborhood is roughly bounded by Columbus Avenue and the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury to the east, Longwood Avenue to the northeast and the Olmsted designed Riverway/ Jamaicaway and the town of Brookline to the west. Northernly is adjacent to the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston. It is served by the MBTA Green Line E Branch and the Orange Line and is within walking distance of the Museum of Fine Arts. \"Coincidences\" Hill with about half of the Longwood Medical and Academic Area, home of 21 health services research and education institutions are responsible for the largest employment area in the city of Boston out of town. Due to these adjacencies, the neighborhood is often struggling with institutional growth has residential buildings and occupying storefront commercial space. But recent years have seen new retail stores, restaurants and residential development in the neighborhood giving a stronger political voice and identity. Mission Hill is historic district architecture with a combination of detached houses built at the beginning of wealthy landowners, blocks of traditional brick row houses and two flats Triple many. Many are condominiums, but there are several families of two and some houses. The district was named in March 2008 as one of the \"25 Best Zip Codes in Massachusetts\" by the Boston Globe, citing a higher value on houses, restaurants and abundant shopping, a marked racial diversity and that 65% of the residents walk, bike or take transportation to work. The district has two main shopping streets: Tremont Street (north and south) and Huntington Ave. (which runs east and west). Both have several small restaurants and shops. Mission Hill is located at the western end of Tremont Street, with Beacon Hill in the east. Mission Hill has two main ZIP Codes; the southern half is designated and the northern 02120 is 02115. In addition, a very small portion of southeastern edge uses the code and 02130 two streets on the western edge use 02215. Parker Hill, Roxbury Crossing, the Triangle District, behind Hill and Calumet Square are areas within the Mission Hill, a designated official in the Boston neighborhood (as evidenced by numerous signs prohibiting parking without a tag only can be received by the residents). Brigham Circle, located at the corner of Tremont and Huntington is the neighborhood shopping center with a grocery store (Stop & Shop), pharmacies, bars, banks and taverns. Furthermore, two other smaller commercial areas are in the neighborhood: Roxbury Crossing and the corner of Huntington and South Huntington near the Brookline line. On Tremont Street is Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica (1878, Schickel and Ditmars, 1910 towers, as well as Franz Joseph Bottom), in a landmark building of the same name which dominates the skyline of the area.

It contains more than 450,000 works of art, becoming one of the most comprehensive collections in the Americas. The museum was founded in 1870 and its current location in 1909. In addition to its storage business, the museum is affiliated with an art academy, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, and a sister museum, and the Nagoya Boston Museum of Fine Arts in Nagoya, Japan. The Museum was founded in 1870 and opened in 1876, with much of its collection taken from the Ateneo Art Gallery in Boston. Francis Davis Millet was instrumental in starting the Art School attached to the museum and get Emil Otto Grundmann (1844 - 1890) named its first director. Originally it was located in an ornate brick Gothic Revival building, designed by John Hubbard Sturgis and Charles Brigham and located in Copley Square in the Back Bay of Boston. The Copley Square building was notable for its large scale use of architectural terra cotta in the United States. The museum moved into its current building on Huntington Avenue, Boston, Avenue of the Arts in 1909. Current museum building was started in 1907, when trustees of the museum hired architect Guy Lowell to create a master plan for a museum could be built in stages as funding was obtained for each phase. The first section of Lowell's neoclassical design was completed in 1909, and featured a 500-ft (150 m), granite facade, cut along Huntington Avenue, the grand rotunda, and the associated exhibition galleries. Ms. Robert Dawson Evans then funded the total cost of building the next section of the museum's master plan. This wing along the marshes of Back Bay, opened in 1915 and houses art galleries. From 1916 until 1925, John Singer Sargent created the art that lines the rotunda and the colonnade partners. Numerous building additions extended throughout the year including the wing of Decorative Arts in 1968 and the Norman Jean Calderwood Court Garden and Terrace in 1997. This wing houses the museum cafy, restaurant and gift shop and exhibition space. In the mid 2000s, the museum embarked on a major renovation project. This includes building a new wing for the arts of the Americas, redesigned and expanded educational facilities, and extensive renovation of its galleries of Europe, visitor services and maintenance services. This expansion increases the size of the MFA by 28% with an additional 133,500 square feet (12,400 m2) of space. The new wing was designed in a restricted way, London's contemporary architecture firm Foster and Partners, headed by Lord (Norman) Foster. Groundbreaking for the addition took place in 2006. In the process, the current garden patio will become a climate-controlled for years round glass enclosure. Landscape architects Gustafson Guthrie Nichol redesigned Huntington Avenue and Fenway entrances, gardens, access roads and courtyards. The opening of the new wing is planned for late 2010.

It was one of the first towns founded in the Colony of Massachusetts Bay in 1630, and became a city in 1846 until annexed to Boston on 5 January 1868. The original town of Roxbury once included current Boston neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain, Roslindale, West Roxbury, South End, and much of Back Bay. Roxbury now generally ends at Columbus Avenue to the north and Lenox Street to the east. Roxbury is now one of the 21 officers in the neighborhoods of Boston, used by the city for the coordination of neighborhood services. The city claims that \"serves as the heart of Black culture in Boston.\" Of the original boundaries of the town of Roxbury can be found in Drake\\'s history of Roxbury and took note of his characters. These limits are the Christian Science Center, the Prudential Center (built on the former rail yard in Roxbury) and the entire south and east of the Muddy River including Symphony Hall, Northeastern University, YMCA, Harvard Medical School and many hospitals and Schools in the area. This side of the Muddy River is Roxbury; the other side is Brookline and Boston. Franklin Park, once fully in Roxbury, where Jamaica Plain, West Roxbury and Roslindale were villages within the town of Roxbury until 1854, has divided the line between Roxbury and Jamaica Plain located in the vicinity of Peter Parley Road at Walnut Avenue, through the Columbia street park. Here, Walnut Avenue changes its name to Sigourney Street, indicating the area is now Jamaica Plain. One side of Columbia Street Roxbury the other is Dorchester. Melnea Cass Boulevard is located approximately in the channel that ships Roxbury in Roxbury since bypassing the busy port of Boston in the 1830s. A store known as the Blue Tent, at the intersection of Washington and Warren Street in Dudley since 1699. Many remember the furniture store known as Ferdinand\\'s Blue Store, as the elevated train in two parts of the building. This area was also home to several famous Boston business firms, Hardware W. Bowman Cutter store with its head down sign, Timothy Smith\\'s Department Store, and JS Waterman and Sons, funeral directors for many prominent families in Boston. Roxbury neighborhood remains a mostly African-Americans as it has been since 1960, but there is a growing population of Puerto Rico. In 1987, Nelson Merced, a Puerto Rican, was chosen for the fifth district of Suffolk in Boston. From the 2000 census Roxbury was 5% non-Hispanic whites, 63% non-Hispanic black or Black, 24% Hispanic or Latino may be of any race, 1% from Asia and Latin, 3% from other races and 4% from two or more races.

To the west of the Shawmut Peninsula, across the bay from Boston, a wide bay opened between Boston and Cambridge, with the Charles River to enter at the west. As with the entire New England coast, the bay was tidal, with water rising and falling several feet throughout the day. Culturally speaking, the Back Bay is known for being the home of the rich and upper middle class. It is best known for its expensive housing and shopping areas. Most stores are located in Newbury and Boylston Street, with the ends closer to the Boston Public Garden traditionally more expensive. Back Bay is full of luxury hotels including the Copley Plaza hotel, the Colonnade Hotel, The Westin Copley Place, Fairmont Copley Plaza, and the largest hotel in the city, the Boston Marriott Copley Place. The Mandarin Oriental, Boston, opened its doors in October 2008 with a house in the arcade area, and a number of luxury designer boutiques and restaurants. The Copley Square area is near the railway terminal of Back Bay, and is the link between the east of a system of hotels and shopping malls connected by a set of glass pedestrian overpasses. Copley Place Mall great includes the first Neiman Marcus opened in the New England area. The system of overpasses extends over half a mile from the Prudential Center and the shops that surround it. The 52-story Prudential Tower, thought a marvel in 1964, is considered by some ugly. However, the Prudential Skywalk observatory offers wonderful views of Back Bay, Boston and its environs. The John Hancock Tower which raises 60 floors and is the tallest building in Boston is a few blocks away. She recently completed nearby skyscrapers are 111 Huntington Ave (36 floors, completed in 2002) and Clarendon (32 floors, completed in 2009). The residential streets of Back Bay are some of the best preserved examples of 19th century urban architecture in the U.S. Copley Square, surrounded by Clarendon, Boylston, Dartmouth, and St. James streets, includes Trinity Church, Boston Public Library, the John Hancock Tower, and other fine examples of architecture. The \"Back Bay Historic District\" was included on the National Register of Historic Places on 14 August 1973. The Prudential Center has awarded the Urban Land Institute Award for Best Mixed-use goods in 2006. The monumental building, for the first time in the square was the Museum of Fine Arts building. Initiated in 1870 and opened in 1876, with much of its collection taken from the Ateneo Art Gallery in Boston. The construction of Gothic Revival red was demolished and rebuilt as the Copley Plaza Hotel still exists today. If you are looking for fine shopping and upper scale dining venues this neighborhood has a lot to offer.

The answer was to unload cargo directly onto the beach. The exigencies of war, along with the expertise and old fashioned Yankee ingenuity combined to create the perfect solution - a vehicle that was half boat and half truck that could run on land and water. Code-named: DUKW. The first \"duck\" was actually a GMC truck enclosed in a water-tight shell. It was not long before DUKWs played a crucial role in the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Pacific and the largest invasion of all, D-Day. In fact, over 40% of all beach supplies in Normandy were transported by DUKWs during the first four months. Boston Duck Tours operates a fleet of restored World War II DUKWs. These amphibious vehicles played an important role in both theaters of Europe and the Pacific war. The Boston Duck Tours and Museum of Science Boston have joined together to present the history of these remarkable vehicles. A special exhibit includes a history of the DUKW, photographs, vintage posters and films. General Motors built 21,000 DUKWs during the war. The display also includes a fully restored Seep. It looks like a miniature DUKW but is actually one of the 12,000 amphibious Jeeps built by Ford Motor Company during World War II. This special exhibit is located in the Science Museum, near the cockpit of Boston Duck Tours ticket. In recent years, Boston Duck Tours has begun to replace the original DUKWs with DUKWs that are easier to maintain and operate. The Boston Duck Tours fleet currently consists of original DUKWs that house 32 people with a new open air deck for the last 8 seats and DUKWs time guests are 36 and are completely closed. DUKWs currently have 15 original and 9 DUKWs at a time. The DUKW type you choose depends on the size of your group and timing of your trip. The Duck Tours has three convenient points of departure including the Museum of Science at 1 Science Park, the Prudential Center in Boston\\'s Back Bay at 53 Huntington Avenue, and the New England Aquarium at 1 Central Wharf. Operating season runs from March 23 through November 29 each year. The tour runs on each weekend throughout December as well. The tours from the Prudential Center and the Museum of Science operate seven days a week rain or shine. Weather does not prevent the tours from these locations from happening. Each tour is approximately 80 minutes when departing from the Prudential Center or Museum of Science and 55 minutes when departing from the New England Aquarium. The tours begin at 9:00 am and the last tour from the Museum of Science and Prudential Center leaves an hour before sunset. Tours leave every 30 or 60 minutes, depending upon the season.
