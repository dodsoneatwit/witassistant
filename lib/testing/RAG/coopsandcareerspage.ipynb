So prior to an interview make sure you understand your work authorization options by talking with your CO-OP + CAREER Advisor and your International Student Services Advisor.\\nHow do I answer the question, “Are you legally authorized to work in the U.S.” on an application?\\nYou can answer “yes” to this question if you are eligible to apply for work authorization and will have the authorization by the time your employment begins.\\nHow do I answer the question, “Will you need visa sponsorship now or in the future?”\\nIf you’ll require the employer to sponsor an immigration or work visa in order to employ you full-time after graduation, either now or at some point in the future, then you should answer “yes.”\\nWhen should I start looking for jobs?\\nWe recommend you start early. Make an appointment with your CO-OP + CAREER Advisor two (or even three) semesters before your employment will begin. It takes time to identify jobs and prepare for CPT or OPT applications, build a network, and find a job.\\nI’ve never interviewed in the U.S., what can I expect?\\nInterviews in the U.S. are commonly informal conversations with hiring managers; they use first names, humor, and spontaneous questions. Following the lead of the interviewer is favored. Your role is to market yourself proactively and answer open ended questions that are both behavioral and technical in nature. Prepare ahead of time so you can articulate the skills you benefits you will bring to the role.

Since 1975, we have offered one of the most comprehensive cooperative education (co-op) programs of its kind in the nation. Each year, more than 1,700 students participate in a semester long, full-time, (almost always) paid work experience that is directly related to their program of study.\\nTo adequately prepare for this life-changing experience, students take a co-op prep class called Intro to Co-op, taught by the Co-op & Career Advisor who is dedicated to the student’s major. Parents are our partners as we work to ensure our students’ success. Please encourage your student to register for Intro to Co-op at least one semester prior to their first co-op.\\nParents as providers of opportunity\\nBecause so many of our students’ parents are leaders in their respective fields, we invite you—if you are able—to provide co-op and employment opportunities to Wentworth students and alumni. To create a successful co-op,\\xa0read the requirements.

Students from most of our majors pursue graduate education. Requirements for admission can vary greatly depending on the type of program. Use the tips and resources below to begin preparing for your graduate journey.\\nDeciding to Pursue Graduate School\\nBefore you start applying it is important to ask yourself some critical questions. This will help you gain clarity and allow you to start developing a plan of action.\\n\\nWhy do you want to go to graduate school?\\nWhat type of degree do you want to pursue? Master’s? PhD? MBA?\\nDo you want to work in industry? Do you want to teach at the college level?\\nDo you want to do academic research?\\nDo you want to enroll immediately after graduating from Wentworth? Do you want to work for a few years first?\\nHow long do you want to be in school? One year? Two years? Five+ years?\\nWhere do you want to be geographically? Does it matter?\\nWhat schools offer your desired program(s) of study in your preferred location?\\n\\nApplying to Graduate Programs\\nOnce you have asked yourself these questions you can start to make an action plan:\\n\\nMake a list of target schools. Consider making a table or matrix that includes the names of program directors/coordinators and their contact information. Reaching out to clarify the importance of each application requirement can help you determine which parts on which to focus your energy. If you are considering a PhD program, it might be good to identify faculty members that you want to work with should you be admitted.\\nConduct outreach – ask clarifying questions about the admissions process, show interest in the program.\\nRank programs. Know their requirements. Work backwards from their deadlines.\\nPrepare for and take the GRE. (Or whichever standardized test the program(s) require). NOTE: Some programs may not require the GRE at all – be sure to confirm with each school. \\nConnect with faculty mentors to get their advice on selecting schools and the application process. (They once went through the same process!).\\nMake an application timeline that ends with application deadlines and works backwards. This will help you stay on track with your research and application materials.\\n\\nOnce you have answered these questions and developed an action plan, you can (and should) speak with your Co-op & Career Advisor for guidance.

You should confirm start dates well in advance, so you know whether you need to take a gap year. (A gap year is time off school between undergraduate and graduate programs).\\n\\n\\nShould I take a gap year? \\n\\nSome individuals may need to take a gap year in order to complete missing academic requirements. Others choose to do so to continue skill-building or to gain additional experience in the field.\\nIf you are not sure what you want to study yet, and you are close to graduating, a gap year could be a good opportunity for you to continue to explore your options.\\n\\n\\nShould I get research experience while at Wentworth? \\n\\nFinding a research co-op or part-time opportunity is important if you are considering graduate schools that require you to conduct research as a part of the program.\\nOn Finding a Research Co-op.

This includes termination, refusing to hire, or denying promotions or raises based on one’s religious beliefs. Employers cannot treat employees more favorably (or less favorably) due to religion, nor can they require employees to participate in a religious activity.\\nIn addition, Title VII requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for religion and religious practices – provided it does not create an ‘undue hardship.’ An example of a reasonable accommodation includes flexible scheduling to allow for a religious observance. Because of this, it is important to know about federal protection from religious discrimination at work. Religious students will find below resources to help them find an organization that respects their religious views, navigate workplace dynamics, and build a professional community.\\nSupport at Wentworth\\nReligion is an important part of many identities, and Co-ops & Careers encourages students to express their beliefs without fear of harassment or discrimination both in the workplace and in their personal lives. You may have questions about how to express your faith at work or about requesting time off for religious observance. Your Co-op & Career Advisor is available by appointment to discuss your concerns and answer questions about how your faith may impact your co-op or job search, workplace dynamics, and professional development.\\nTalk with us about\\n\\nStrategies to navigate religious expression at work.\\nHow to communicate and request accommodations for religious purposes.\\nIdentify ways to explore your personal religious journey.\\nAddressing harassment and discrimination in the workplace and during interviews.\\nExploring the ways work and religion intersect.\\nHow to include religious events and groups on your resume and in job interviews.\\n\\nOn campus\\n\\nPrayer & Meditation Room (Beatty Hall 029) is a space to pray, reflect, or mediate and is open to all students, staff, and faculty.\\nThe Center for Diversity and Global Engagement is a good place to explore and discuss all facets of religion and spirituality; use the CDGE to find a community that shares your beliefs and ideas, both on campus and off.\\nConnect with student organization to build a network of support.

Employers attending are hiring for full-time and/or fall co-ops. You can find a complete list of employers attending and the majors and positions for which they are hiring under Events on WITworks.\\n\\n\\n\\nWill there be a bag check?\\nNo, there will be no bag check at the Recruiting Reception. We strongly recommend you leave your belongings at home or in your locker or vehicle. If you must bring your bag, you must carry it with you through the event.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat happens during a recruiting reception?\\nThe Recruiting Reception is more casual than a Co-op & Career Fair. At this event you will mingle with employers at small tables rather than walk up to a specific booth. This event is an opportunity to tell employers about yourself, learn about current or future openings, get questions answered and make professional connections. The outcome may be an interview this summer.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat should I bring?\\nYou should be prepared with your 30-second pitch and enough copies of your resume to give at least one to each employer with whom you wish to speak (and few extra just in case). You do not need to bring any cover letters! Use our Resume Guide to update your resume with your most recent experience.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the dress code?\\nRecommended attire is business casual. Check out the What to Wear guidelines on our What to Wear and How to Prepare resource hub for tips on putting together an outfit. Please note that jeans, T-shirts, and shorts are not business casual.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs there a rain date?\\nNo, in the event of inclement weather that prevents us from using the tent we will move the event indoors to a TBD location.\\n\\n\\n\\nWill there be a LinkedIn photo booth?\\nNo there will not be a headshot station at the Recruiting Reception.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere can I find more information about the employers attending?\\nWe keep an up-to-date list of registered employers on this page. Find additional information about each organization attending the Fair and the positions for which they are hiring under Events on WITworks.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat if I cannot attend the event but I want to submit my resume to one or more employer?\\nIf you cannot attend the event, please apply to the position(s) the employer(s) have posted on WITworks.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout our Events\\nCo-ops & Careers offers annual opportunities for students and alumni to connect with employers, network, and learn about available co-ops and full-time jobs. Our signature events will be highlighted on this page before each program. Check out our events calendar for a complete list of upcoming on and off-campus co-op and career related events.\\nAccessibility and Accommodations\\nWentworth Institute of Technology is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in all University programs and activities.

Students and alumni will find below a range of on-campus and external resources and information to help them through their search for a meaningful co-op and career and with acclimating to the workplace.\\nSupport at Wentworth\\nEveryone brings their own story, skills, and interests to their job search and as employees. However, LGBTQ+ students and alumni often come to us with similar questions and concerns about their search for work and transition to the workplace. LGBTQ+ students and alumni may need support with disclosing their gender identity or pronouns, addressing workplace harassment and discrimination, and building a supportive professional community. Additionally, laws protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ employees are not universal and fluctuate by state and country.\\nYour Co-op & Career Advisor is available by appointment to provide advice and support about gender identity and/or sexual orientation specific to your co-op or job search, workplace dynamics, and professional development.\\nTalk with us about\\n\\nFinding an LGBTQ+ friendly employer.\\nLeveraging your connections in the LGBTQ+ community to find a job.\\nFinding employee resource groups.\\nIf, when, and how to come out to your colleagues.\\nHow and when to disclose your pronouns.\\nFilling out forms with binary genders if you identify as non-binary.\\nFilling out forms asking for legal name if you go by your preferred name.\\nAddressing workplace and interview discrimination and harassment regarding your gender identity or sexual orientation.\\n\\nOn campus\\nThe main on-campus resource for LGBTQ+ students is the The Center for Diversity and Global Engagement. Check out their website for office hours, upcoming events, and resources.\\nIn addition, we recommend students get involved with Queer Leopard Alliance, the student run campus club focused on creating an atmosphere of acceptance at Wentworth.

The perspectives and experiences these folks bring to a work environment are inherently valuable, though the journey to success may be difficult due to systemic barriers created and upheld by white supremacy. Students and alumni who identify as BIPOC (or any of the identities therein) will find below a wealth of resources to help them on the road to finding meaningful co-ops and careers.\\nSupport at Wentworth\\nBIPOC students do not grow up with the same lived experience and culture, but there are some common challenges that they may face during the job search process and while in the workplace. BIPOC students may need support with identifying whether or not a company is inclusive, addressing harassment or discrimination in the workplace, and building a network where they may not have one. Additionally, employers may seem eager to hire diverse talent, but many are not prepared to do so.\\nTalk with us about:\\n\\nExpanding your network or building a professional network from the ground up.\\nHow to determine whether or not a company or workplace is inclusive.\\nHarassment, discrimination, and unconscious bias in the workplace and interview process.\\nPresenting your race or ethnicity in the application process.\\nSharing involvement in cultural groups on- or off-campus on your resume.\\n\\nOn-Campus Resources and Communities:\\nThe main on-campus resource for BIPOC students is the Center for Diversity and Global Engagement. Check out their website for office hours, upcoming events, and resources. There are a number of cultural and identity-based professional groups on-campus that we recommend students get involved with – more information, social media, and meeting times can be found on Leopard Spot.\\nResources\\nGeneral BIPOC Resources\\nHack.Diversity\\nIs a workforce development nonprofit advancing a more inclusive, innovative, and prosperous Boston.

This guide is meant to clarify some of that ambiguity and offer you some direction, when preparing. Whatever your gender expression and personal style may be, THE MOST IMPORTANT thing to remember is that you should put your best and most authentic self forward.\\n\\nYour Outfit \\n\\nSuits or blazer & pant/skirt/dress combination is encouraged- especially if you are interviewing (in-person or remotely).\\n\\n\\nAvoid transparent or sheer clothing.\\n\\n\\nShirts, polos, or blouses, should be tucked in.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAccessories- ties, jewelry, scarves, pocket squares- are a great way to showcase your personality and dress-up an outfit. Just keep in mind- sometimes less is more.\\n\\n\\nDress pants, khakis/chinos, and dark pants are a good alternative to a full suit/dress/skirt.\\n\\n\\nSkirts and dresses are a great option for interviews, just be mindful of overly formal options which may not be appropriate for an interview- like prom gowns and party attire.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDress shoes, loafers/boat shoes, flats, or sensible heels are the best choices, but other clean, dark color footwear can be used as an alternative.\\n\\n\\nIf you are wearing pants that have belt loops and your shirt is tucked in, you should be wearing a belt.\\n\\n Grooming/Physical Presentation \\n\\nShowering, combing/styling your hair, and using appropriate hygiene are important.\\n\\n\\nYour clothes should be wrinkle free!\\n\\n\\nPlease be mindful when wearing cologne, perfumes, aftershave, deodorants, or other products with fragrances- some people can have severe allergic reactions to certain or strong scents.\\n\\n Helpful Tips \\n\\nRegardless of an organization’s day-to-day culture or â€˜vibeâ€™, career fairs and interviews are occasions where employers want to see the best version of you. You may be able to wear a t-shirt after you get hired ðŸ˜Š.\\n\\n\\nDistracting clothing, accessories, or grooming can potentially shift the employerâ€™s focus away from your skills and qualifications. So keep that in mind.\\n\\n\\nTies arenâ€™t mandatory, but can help an outfit stand out more, especially if you are not wearing a blazer/suit jacket.\\n\\n\\nIf possible, try to match the color of your belt to the color of your shoes.\\n\\n\\nDress socks or pantyhose/tights arenâ€™t mandatory but can help you look less casual.\\n\\n\\nThe goal is for the employer to focus their attention on your skills and qualifications.\\n\\n\\nIf you donâ€™t own/canâ€™t find an iron, put your clothes in a dryer with a damp towel for 5-10 minutes, take the clothes out immediately (donâ€™t leave them sitting in the dryer), and lay them out flat. This should lessen the appearance of wrinkles.\\n\\n\\nIf you havenâ€™t showered and canâ€™t get home before your event/interview, the Schuman Fitness Center has free shower facilities you can use-including a towel!\\n\\n\\nJeans and leggings are often perceived as â€˜unprofessionalâ€™. If this is your only option, darker colors and no tears/holes, paired with a dress shirt/blouse are best.\\n\\n\\nIf you wear a short-sleeve polo shirt, we recommend tucking it in, especially if you are not wearing a blazer/suit jacket.\\n\\n\\nYour hair/facial hairâ€™s style, texture, color, length is NOT up for discussion by an employer. If this happens to you, politely inform them you are not comfortable discussing it and share the experience with the Human Resources department of the company and/or the staff at the Co-ops & Careers office.\\xa0\\n\\n Things to Avoid \\n\\nShorts\\nT-Shirts\\nSandals\\nSheer, mesh, or transparent fabrics\\nTorn clothing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Make an Introduction\\nCombine many of the following components to create your introduction:\\n\\nGreeting & Education: include your first and last name, your class year and major.\\nOpportunities you are seeking: mention the specific position that they are hiring for or a type of role you are interested in.\\nRelevant Experience: reference related experience to the specific job you want and mention any co-ops and/or projects.\\nHighlights of Skills & Strengths: share skills you possess that are related to the qualifications.\\nKnowledge of company: do research about the company beforehand and ask a question that cannot be easily answered from their website.\\n\\n\\n Links (click to expand) \\n\\xa0\\n\\nCareer Fair Prep\\nIntroducing Yourself\\nResearch and Network with the LinkedIn Alumni Tool\\nJob Search & Networking\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nÂ\\xa0\\n\\nHow to Perfect your Resume\\nA great resume is easy to scan, highlights accomplishments, and concisely details your abilities.Contact Information\\n\\nInclude a professional sounding email address (huntingtona@wit.edu)\\nLinked your LinkedIn, Github, portfolio, and personal website.\\n\\nDo not put a QR code on your Resume, write out the link instead\\n\\n\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nEducation remains at the top if you are currently a student.\\nIf you transferred in, you may or may not include your previous school depending on its relevance or if you earned a degree.\\nList your degree as it appears on your transcript, including minors and concentrations.\\nInclude your GPA, if it is at or above 3.0, and any academic honors.\\n\\nRelated Courses – subsection of Education\\n\\nList 5-10 in order of relevance and consider dropping pre-requisite courses.\\n\\nSkills\\n\\nList and categorize your hard skills. Programs? Software? Devices? Languages? Test instruments? Lab equipment? Operating systems? Design? Field? Digital? Building technology?\\n\\nProjects\\n\\nList your accomplishments using action verbs to highlight your skills with the tools you used when possible.\\n\\nRelevant Experiences\\n\\nBullet format if preferred as it makes your resume easy to skim.\\nQuantify when possible to make your point.\\nEx.: “Collaborated with four-person team to achieve three times original power output based on simulator results for a small manufacturer of electronics.”\\n\\n\\n  Links (click to expand)  \\n\\nHow to Keep Your Resume to One Page\\nResume Grammar Guide\\nTechnical Competencies\\nResume Guide\\nAction Verbs\\nTransferable Skills\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nÂ\\xa0\\n\\nHow to Answer Questions\\nBe prepared to answer key interview questions\\n\\nTell me about yourself.\\nWhy are you interested in this position?\\nHow have you prepared yourself for this position?\\nWhy should we hire you?\\nWhat do you know about this company/department?\\nWhat are your professional goals?\\nWhat’s the most difficult challenge you have faced in life?\\n\\nBe prepared to give answers to questions, even if the employer doesn’t ask them. Remember, always provide examples of your work, skills and abilities.\\n\\nSpeak slowly, clearly and enunciate.\\nIf you didn’t understand the question, you can ask the interviewer for clarification, to repeat, or to rephrase the question.\\nIf you need time to think about your answer, you can say, “What an interesting question! Let me think about that for a moment.”\\nIf they ask you something that you don’t know, it is okay to say, “I don’t know, but I will look into that and get back to you.” Then provide the answer in your thank you note.\\nThe first time they ask you about salary, don’t let them make it about the money. Say something like: “For me, it is not about compensation, I am more interested in the development opportunity.” If they ask you again, never give a number, always give a range.\\nTake notes during your interview. They will be useful when writing your thank you note, and it indicates that you are diligent and interested in the position.\\nInclude at least one question that demonstrates that you’ve done research on the company.\\n\\n\\n  Links (click to expand)  \\n\\nTips for Effective Video Interviewing\\nSmall Talk Interview Etiquette\\nTechnical Interviews\\nInterview Prep\\nFollow-Up Thank You Email Samples\\nCommonly Asked Interview Questions for Co-op\\nCommonly Asked Interview Questions for Alumni\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Resources \\nCo-op \\nCommon Interview Questions for Co-opCo-op with a ProfessorHow to Approach New Employers for StudentsLibrary Research Guide \\nCo-ops & Careers HandoutsShow more Co-ops & Careers Handouts \\nInterview PrepCommon Interview Questions for Co-opNavigating Job OffersLinkedIn GuideJob Search & NetworkingCareer Fair PrepFollow-Up Thank You Email SamplesHow to Write a Productive EmailInformational InterviewsTechnical InterviewsDelivering Your IntroductionCommonly Asked Interview Questions for AlumniCo-op with a ProfessorHow to Approach New Employers for StudentsHow to Prepare for an IT Support InterviewJoining Groups on LinkedInResearch and Network with the LinkedIn Alumni ToolSmall Talk Interview EtiquetteTips for Effective Video InterviewingEngineering Portfolio GuideInformational Interview Email SamplesDress to ImpressDressing for Business CasualCareer Fair or Networking Follow-Up \\nShow more Co-ops & Careers HandoutsResume \\nLibrary Research GuideBest Practices for International Students on the US Job Search \\nCover Letter \\nLibrary Research GuideBest Practices for International Students on the US Job Search \\nNetworkingShow more Networking \\nLinkedIn GuideJob Search & NetworkingCareer Fair PrepHow to Write a Productive EmailInformational InterviewsDelivering Your IntroductionCo-op with a ProfessorHow to Approach New Employers for StudentsJoining Groups on LinkedInResearch and Network with the LinkedIn Alumni ToolSmall Talk Interview EtiquetteInformational Interview Email SamplesDressing for Business CasualLGBTQ Student ResourcesLibrary Research GuideQuestions to Ask Employers at Virtual EventsGender Neutral Guide: What to Wear For An InterviewRecruiting Reception vs. Co-op & Career FairAbilityLinksBest Practices for International Students on the US Job SearchChickTech \\nShow more NetworkingLinkedIn \\nLinkedIn GuideJoining Groups on LinkedInResearch and Network with the LinkedIn Alumni ToolLibrary Research Guide \\nCo-op & Career FairShow more Co-op & Career Fair \\nCareer Fair PrepFollow-Up Thank You Email SamplesDelivering Your IntroductionDress to ImpressWITwearQuestions to Ask Employers at Virtual EventsCareer Fair or Networking Follow-Up \\nShow more Co-op & Career FairInterviews & OffersShow more Interviews & Offers \\nInterview PrepCommon Interview Questions for Co-opNavigating Job OffersFollow-Up Thank You Email SamplesTechnical InterviewsCommonly Asked Interview Questions for AlumniHow to Prepare for an IT Support InterviewSmall Talk Interview EtiquetteTips for Effective Video InterviewingEngineering Portfolio GuideDress to ImpressLibrary Research GuideJob Interview QuestionsGender Neutral Guide: What to Wear For An InterviewBest Practices for International Students on the US Job SearchLinkedIn Interview Prep Tool \\nShow more Interviews & OffersNegotiation \\nBest Practices for International Students on the US Job Search \\nFull-Time Job Search \\nCommonly Asked Interview Questions for Alumni \\nIdentity \\nAbilityLinksBest Practices for International Students on the US Job SearchChickTech \\nPortfolio \\nEngineering Portfolio Guide \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWentworth Institute of TechnologyCo-ops & Careers\\n \\n\\nBlog\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\n\\nInstagram\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\n\\n\\nX (formerly Twitter)\\n\\n\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tWentworth Hall 101550 Huntington AveBoston, MA 02115(617) 989-4101coopsandcareers@wit.edu \\n\\n\\n\\nPrivacy Policy | Terms of Service\\n\\nCopyright © 2024 Wentworth Institute of Technology\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://coopsandcareers.wit.edu/resources/what-to-wear-and-how-to-prepare/', 'title': 'What to Wear and How to Prepare – Co-ops + Careers | Wentworth Institute of Technology', 'language': 'en-US'}),\n",

At Wentworth a co-op must be 30-40 hours per week and generally is completed between the first day of classes and the last day of finals during the semester you are working.\\n \\n\\nWentworth offers one of the most comprehensive co-op programs in the nation. Unlike most schools, co-op at Wentworth is a requirement: all undergraduate day students must successfully complete two co-op semesters in order to graduate.\\nYou will have plenty of support to help you achieve your professional goals. Your first step is to enroll in and complete COOP2500, Intro to Co-op, a co-op preparation course that is offered in the spring and fall semesters. Additionally, your dedicated Co-op & Career Advisor will work with you on résumé writing, job-search strategies, and interviewing techniques. We provide a Co-op & Career fair or reception each semester including summer, focused workshops, online job search tools, and on-campus recruiting.\\nFind all co-op policies and procedures in the Co-op Handbook.\\n\\nCo-op Handbook\\nHow to Register for Co-op\\n\\n\\nImportant Upcoming Co-op Dates:\\nTypically Sophomores*Typically SeniorsTypically JuniorsCo-op Schedule Summer 2024Fall 2024Spring 2025Semester begins (first official start date of co-op)Thursday, May 2Tuesday, September 3TBALast day to report your hireThursday, May 9Tuesday, September 10TBALatest employment start dateWednesday, May 15Thursday, September 12TBACo-op assessment due – student & employerFriday, August 2Wednesday, December 3TBALast day of official co-op semesterThursday, August 15Friday, December 6TBA*Some\\xa0programs of study\\xa0follow a different schedule.\\n\\n\\n\\nTiming\\n\\nWith the exception of Architecture, Applied Mathematics, and Data Science all students must complete their required co-ops in the spring semester of their junior year and the fall semester of their senior year.\\nWith the exception of Architecture and Applied Mathematics (3-year program), students may complete an optional co-op the summer following their sophomore year. Note that optional co-ops cannot be applied toward the graduation requirement.\\nArchitecture majors will complete their co-ops during the summer after their sophomore year and the spring of their junior year.\\nApplied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Data Science student in 3-year programs will complete their co-ops during the summer semester following their sophomore year and the spring semester of their final year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBenefits\\n\\nYour co-op experiences will be directly related to your field of study, allowing you to tie your coursework to concrete knowledge developed in the workplace.\\n38% of the class of 2022 were offered post-graduate full-time employment by their co-op employer(s).\\nDuring your co-op experiences, you earn income and not pay tuition, allowing you to save toward future semesters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEligibility\\n\\nEligibility for co-ops is determined by your class standing and cumulative GPA (check the academic catalogue for your major’s requirement).\\nReview the Co-op Handbook for policies, procedures and general information.\\nInternational students are not allowed to participate in a co-op in the cannabis industry. It is a violation of federal immigration laws for a foreign national to have anything to do with marijuana cultivation.\\nAlthough Cannabis has been legalized both recreationally and medicinally in some states, it remains illegal under federal law. Wentworth Institute of Technology is a drug-free campus, consistent with federal law. Wentworth may post co-op positions in the cannabis industry in those states that have legalized medical and/or recreational use of cannabis but cautions that the use and/or sale of cannabis may be prosecuted by federal law enforcement and that any such co-ops, research, or job opportunities could potentially affect your federal student loans, immigration status, or future background checks for security clearances. Any student who chooses to engage in such employment does so at their own risk. Wentworth will approve co-ops that are ancillary to the organization but not for jobs where the students would be handling cannabis (like a dispensary).\\xa0 Examples, a co-op may be approved if the student is working in the IT department or other business functions within a cannabis organization but will not be approved where the student is touching the cannabis. Therefore, Wentworth advises international students, students with federal loans and students who may seek a security clearance in the future to not work in the cannabis industry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResources \\n\\nSkip filter options to posts\\n\\n\\n\\nFilter\\nClear\\n\\n\\nFilter:\\n\\n\\n\\nFilters\\nSee More Filters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFilter Controls\\n\\n\\nResource Categories:Co-op Co-ops & Careers Handouts Resume Cover Letter Networking LinkedIn Co-op & Career Fair Interviews & Offers Negotiation Full-Time Job Search For Employers International Identity References Portfolio Expert-Recommended Resources Job Board  \\n\\nClose\\nClear Filters\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegistering for Co-opShare This: Share Registering for Co-op on FacebookShare Registering for Co-op on LinkedInShare Registering for Co-op on XCopy LinkRegistering for co-op is a two-step process.

A diagnosis is not required to participate.\\nOn campus\\nThe main on-campus resource for students with disabilities is the Success Studio. Check out the Success Studio’s Accessibility Services Page to find information about requesting campus accommodations and the ongoing support available to you.
