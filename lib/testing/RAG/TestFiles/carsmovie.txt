"Cars" is a 2006 animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by John Lasseter, the movie takes place in a world populated by anthropomorphic cars and other vehicles. The story follows a race car named Lightning McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, who finds himself stranded in the small town of Radiator Springs on Route 66 after accidentally detouring off the interstate.

In Radiator Springs, Lightning McQueen meets a variety of quirky characters, including Sally (a Porsche voiced by Bonnie Hunt), Mater (a tow truck voiced by Larry the Cable Guy), and Doc Hudson (a retired race car voiced by Paul Newman). Through his interactions with the residents of Radiator Springs, Lightning McQueen learns valuable lessons about friendship, community, and the importance of slowing down and appreciating the journey.

The film's themes of friendship, redemption, and self-discovery, along with its stunning animation and heartwarming story, have made it a beloved classic among both children and adults. "Cars" was followed by two sequels, "Cars 2" (2011) and "Cars 3" (2017), as well as several short films and spin-off series. The franchise has also inspired theme park attractions, merchandise, and a dedicated fan base.
